# **Chapter 1: What is a Web Service?**

## **Introduction**

Think of a **web service** like a **waiter in a restaurant**.
The customer (your app or the browser) asks for something.
The waiter (the web service) carries the request to the kitchen (your backend code + database).
The kitchen prepares the result, and the waiter brings it back to the customer.

A web service does the same job—**it carries requests and brings back responses**, but instead of food, it delivers **data**.

## **Concepts**

* **Web Service:** A program that allows two systems to talk to each other over the internet.
* **Request:** What the user is asking for (e.g., “give me the user list”).
* **Response:** What the server sends back (e.g., the actual list of users).
* **REST:** A simple and commonly used way to design web services.
* **GraphQL:** A newer style that gives more control to the client about what data they want.

## **Step-by-step Explanation**

### **1. What exactly is a web service?**

A web service is a small program that:

* Receives a request from the frontend or another system
* Processes information (sometimes using a database)
* Sends back a reply

Just like:

```
Customer -> Waiter -> Kitchen -> Waiter -> Customer
```

In tech terms:

```
Client -> Web Service -> Database/Logic -> Web Service -> Client
```

### **2. Why do we need web services?**

Because apps on mobile, web browsers, or other systems need a **standard way** to communicate.
Web services act like a universal language.

Examples:

* A shopping app checking product prices
* A delivery app checking order status
* A bank app requesting account balance

All these happen through web services.

## **3. REST vs GraphQL (Very Simple Overview)**

### **REST (like ordering from a fixed menu)**

* You hit fixed URLs like `/products`, `/users`, `/orders/123`.
* Each URL returns a fixed kind of data.
* Very simple and easy to learn.
* Most backend systems use REST.

Example:
When you call `/products`, you always get the same type of data.

### **GraphQL (like choosing exactly what ingredients you want)**

* You send **one request** and tell the server exactly what fields you want.
* You can combine multiple data pieces in one request.
* Useful when the client wants flexibility.

Example:
Instead of getting the whole product record, you can ask:

```
Give me only product name and price
```

## **Code Examples**

### **Simple REST API (FastAPI example)**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/greet")
def greet():
    return {"message": "Hello! I am your web service."}
```

### **Very Simple GraphQL Example**

Using Strawberry (only to show the idea):

```python
import strawberry
from strawberry.fastapi import GraphQLRouter

@strawberry.type
class Query:
    hello: str = "Hello from GraphQL!"

schema = strawberry.Schema(query=Query)
graphql_app = GraphQLRouter(schema)
```

Client can ask:

```graphql
{
  hello
}
```

## **How Codex Helps**

You can ask Codex to:

### **1. Generate a REST API**

Prompt example:

```
Create a FastAPI service with routes /users, /products, and /orders.
Each should return sample JSON data.
```

### **2. Create folder structures**

Prompt:

```
Generate a clean backend project structure for a FastAPI + MySQL app.
Include routers, models, and services folders.
```

### **3. Add new features**

Prompt:

```
Add a new API endpoint /customers that returns sample customer data.
Use the existing project structure.
```

### **4. Debug**

Prompt:

```
My FastAPI is giving a 422 error. Here is the code: <paste>. Tell me what's wrong.
```

Codex can read, improve, and fix your code step-by-step.

## **Small Exercise**

Create a simple REST API with one endpoint:

`/hello`

It should return:

```json
{"message": "Welcome to Web Services!"}
```

Then ask Codex:

```
Improve this API by adding another endpoint /info that returns your name and city.
```
