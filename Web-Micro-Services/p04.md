# **Chapter 4: Introduction to OpenAI Codex**

## **Introduction**

OpenAI Codex is like having a **super-skilled junior developer** sitting beside you, ready to write code, improve code, explain errors, build APIs, and generate entire backend structures.
But just like a junior developer, **Codex needs proper instructions**, and there are things it **can** and **cannot** do.

In this chapter, you will understand **what Codex is good at**, **what its limits are**, and **how to use it safely** for building backend systems in Python, FastAPI, and MySQL.
We will also see **how to use Codex inside VS Code and through the CLI** to speed up your workflow.

## **Concepts**

* What Codex can generate
* What Codex cannot do
* Safety practices when developing backend systems
* Using VS Code extension
* Using Codex CLI for large projects

---

## **Step-by-step Explanation**

### **1. What Codex Can Generate**

Codex is excellent at producing **structured, predictable code**.
Here are the main things it can do:

#### ✔ **A. Generate API code**

Example:

* FastAPI routes
* CRUD endpoints
* Auth flow
* MySQL models
* Database functions

Think of Codex as someone who can write the skeleton very fast, while you check the details.

#### ✔ **B. Create complete folder structures**

Example:

```
app/
 ├─ models/
 ├─ routers/
 ├─ schemas/
 ├─ services/
 ├─ main.py
```

#### ✔ **C. Improve existing code**

You can paste your code and ask:

* “Improve this naming”
* “Add error handling”
* “Add validation”
* “Rewrite using services layer pattern”

Codex will rewrite your code cleanly.

#### ✔ **D. Convert requirements into working modules**

Example:

* “Create a user registration module”
* “Add JWT-based login system”
* “Create MySQL models with SQLAlchemy”

#### ✔ **E. Debug errors**

Codex can detect:

* Routing mistakes
* Validation issues
* SQL mistakes
* Incorrect data types

You paste the error → Codex explains it and fixes the code.

#### ✔ **F. Add new features without breaking existing code**

Example:

* “Add pagination to user list”
* “Add search filter to product list”
* “Add microservice for notifications”

---

### **2. What Codex Cannot Do**

Just like a junior developer, Codex has **limitations**:

#### ✖ **A. It cannot fully understand your entire system unless you show the code**

Codex only sees what you paste or upload.
It does NOT scan your whole laptop or entire company project.

#### ✖ **B. It cannot guess missing details**

If your instructions are unclear, Codex will fill gaps incorrectly.
You must give:

* clear instructions
* examples
* expected output format

#### ✖ **C. It cannot test the system by itself**

You must run the code, test APIs, and check results.

#### ✖ **D. It cannot replace human architectural thinking**

Codex writes code fast, but:

* designing the database
* planning microservices
* deciding API contracts
  … still requires your mind.

#### ✖ **E. It does not remember previous project files unless provided**

Codex is not a project memory system.
You must upload or paste required code for context.

---

### **3. How to Use Codex Safely for Backend Development**

When using Codex for backend work, safety means:

* avoiding accidental bugs
* avoiding security flaws
* ensuring consistency in architecture

Here are safe practices:

#### ✔ **A. Always ask Codex to work in small steps**

Example:

> “Add only the POST endpoint first. Do not change anything else.”

This prevents accidental changes.

#### ✔ **B. Always show Codex the full file if you want modifications**

If you only show half the file, Codex may break the rest.

#### ✔ **C. Use clear, strict instructions**

Example:

> “Use Pydantic models. Do not add any extra fields.”

#### ✔ **D. After Codex generates code, YOU run and test it**

Codex never executes code itself.

#### ✔ **E. Review for security issues**

Codex may generate:

* insecure SQL
* missing validation
* weak password handling

You must verify these manually.

#### ✔ **F. Avoid giving Codex private credentials**

Never paste:

* AWS keys
* DB passwords
* API keys

Use placeholders.

### **4. Using Codex VS Code Extension Effectively**

Codex inside VS Code behaves like an **AI pair programmer**.

#### ✔ **A. Inline code suggestions**

As you type:

```python
@app.get("/users")
```

Codex may automatically suggest the function body.

#### ✔ **B. Ask Codex questions in the sidebar**

Example:

> “Generate MySQL model for ‘Customer’ with name, email, phone.”

#### ✔ **C. Use Command Palette**

Press:

```
Ctrl + Shift + P  →  OpenAI: Ask Codex
```

Paste your query.
Codex generates code directly into your editor.

#### ✔ **D. Use it to refactor**

Select code → Right-click → “Improve with Codex”.

### **5. Using Codex CLI Effectively**

The CLI is powerful for **big projects**.

### ✔ **A. Upload your entire project folder**

Codex reads it fully.
You can then ask:

* “Add new feature”
* “Fix errors”
* “Create new microservice”

### ✔ **B. Ask Codex to modify specific folders**

Example:

```
Modify only router/user_router.py to add PUT endpoint.
```

### ✔ **C. Run step-by-step development**

Example workflow:

1. “Create FastAPI boilerplate”
2. “Add authentication module”
3. “Add user microservice”
4. “Add order microservice”
5. “Add gateway”

Codex keeps updating code **without breaking old files**.

### ✔ **D. Use CLI for debugging**

You can paste logs or tracebacks.
Codex fixes errors across files.

---

## **Code Examples**

### **Example 1: Ask Codex to generate an API skeleton**

```
Create a FastAPI CRUD for products with id, name, price.
Include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
```

### **Example 2: Ask Codex to improve existing code**

```
Here is my FastAPI POST endpoint. Improve validations but keep logic unchanged:
<code>
```

### **Example 3: Ask Codex to create microservices**

```
Split this monolithic FastAPI app into auth-service, order-service, and payment-service.
Create folder structure and router templates.
```

## **How Codex Helps**

Use Codex for:

* API generation
* folder structure
* debugging
* adding features
* converting monolith → microservices
* writing DB models
* generating documentation
* fixing error logs

Codex is your assistant developer—fast, smart, and tireless.

---

## **Small Exercise**

1. Create a simple FastAPI project with one route: `/hello`.
2. Open VS Code → Ask Codex:

   ```
   Add another endpoint /sum that receives two numbers and returns the total.
   ```
3. Then ask Codex:

   ```
   Improve input validation so both numbers must be integers.
   ```

This teaches you:

* how to give instructions
* how to improve code in steps
* how to keep your backend clean
