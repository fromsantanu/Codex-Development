# Chapter 23. Calling REST APIs from React

## Introduction
- The Calling REST APIs from React page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Fetching data is sliding a folder from the records clerk to the desk so everyone sees the latest notes.
- Calling REST APIs from React is the reason our frontend talks to the API, pulling new arrivals and sending updates without extra clicks.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Calling REST APIs from React intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Calling REST APIs from React is about.
   ```jsx
   function CallingRestApisIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Calling REST APIs from React at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Calling REST APIs from React matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the CallingRestApisIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Calling REST APIs from React.

2. Display Calling REST APIs from React data
   - Explanation Map over sample records so Calling REST APIs from React looks like live data from the API.
   ```jsx
   const sampleRecords = [
     { id: '1', label: 'Maya' },
     { id: '2', label: 'Dev' }
   ];
   function CallingRestApisList() {
     return (
       <div>
         {sampleRecords.map(record => (
           <article key={record.id}>
             <strong>{record.label}</strong>
             <p>Calling REST APIs from React note</p>
           </article>
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Let Codex format those sample records into cards so Calling REST APIs from React looks ready for real data.

3. Call the API for Calling REST APIs from React
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Calling REST APIs from React mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Calling REST APIs from React');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Calling REST APIs from React records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Calling REST APIs from React and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Calling REST APIs from React from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Calling REST APIs from React component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Calling REST APIs from React fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Wire a small filter that lets you call /api/appointments with a query so you can see subsets of Calling REST APIs from React.
