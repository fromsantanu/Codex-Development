# Chapter 38. Drag and Drop UI

## Introduction
- The Drag and Drop UI page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Advanced widgets such as drag-and-drop or charts are the high-tech kiosks that make the waiting room look modern.
- Drag and Drop UI shines when we add these smart touches to Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Drag and Drop UI intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Drag and Drop UI is about.
   ```jsx
   function DragAndDropIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Drag and Drop UI at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Drag and Drop UI matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the DragAndDropIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Drag and Drop UI.

2. Drag Drag and Drop UI cards around
   - Explanation Drag-and-drop is like moving files between doctors’ desks when the day changes.
   ```jsx
   function DragAndDropDrag() {
     const handleDragStart = event => event.dataTransfer.setData('text/plain', 'appointment');
     return <div draggable onDragStart={handleDragStart}>Drag Drag and Drop UI card</div>;
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Prompt Codex to build a draggable card so staff can reorganize Drag and Drop UI quickly.

3. Call the API for Drag and Drop UI
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Drag and Drop UI mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Drag and Drop UI');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Drag and Drop UI records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Drag and Drop UI and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Drag and Drop UI from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Drag and Drop UI component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Drag and Drop UI fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Pair the advanced widget with live data so Drag and Drop UI reacts when the backend updates.
