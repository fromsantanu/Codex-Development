# Chapter 24. Showing API Data in Lists and Tables

## Introduction
- The Showing API Data in Lists and Tables page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Fetching data is sliding a folder from the records clerk to the desk so everyone sees the latest notes.
- Showing API Data in Lists and Tables is the reason our frontend talks to the API, pulling new arrivals and sending updates without extra clicks.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Showing API Data in Lists and Tables intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Showing API Data in Lists and Tables is about.
   ```jsx
   function ShowingApiDataIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Showing API Data in Lists and Tables at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Showing API Data in Lists and Tables matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the ShowingApiDataIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Showing API Data in Lists and Tables.

2. Display Showing API Data in Lists and Tables data
   - Explanation Map over sample records so Showing API Data in Lists and Tables looks like live data from the API.
   ```jsx
   const sampleRecords = [
     { id: '1', label: 'Maya' },
     { id: '2', label: 'Dev' }
   ];
   function ShowingApiDataList() {
     return (
       <div>
         {sampleRecords.map(record => (
           <article key={record.id}>
             <strong>{record.label}</strong>
             <p>Showing API Data in Lists and Tables note</p>
           </article>
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Let Codex format those sample records into cards so Showing API Data in Lists and Tables looks ready for real data.

3. Call the API for Showing API Data in Lists and Tables
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Showing API Data in Lists and Tables mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Showing API Data in Lists and Tables');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Showing API Data in Lists and Tables records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Showing API Data in Lists and Tables and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Showing API Data in Lists and Tables from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Showing API Data in Lists and Tables component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Showing API Data in Lists and Tables fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Wire a small filter that lets you call /api/appointments with a query so you can see subsets of Showing API Data in Lists and Tables.
