# Chapter 46. Project 2: Sales Dashboard

## Introduction
- The Sales Dashboard page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/sales so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Projects stitch everything together like a full patient intake workflow.
- Sales Dashboard becomes a dependable ritual when the entire front desk UI at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk is tied end-to-end.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Sales Dashboard intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Sales Dashboard is about.
   ```jsx
   function SalesDashboardIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Sales Dashboard at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Sales Dashboard matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the SalesDashboardIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Sales Dashboard.

2. Summarize Sales Dashboard metrics
   - Explanation Dashboards breathe life into sales numbers so the clinic can feel the pulse.
   ```jsx
   function SalesDashboardDashboard() {
     const stats = [{ label: 'Today', value: 28 }];
     return <div>{stats.map(stat => <div key={stat.label}>{stat.label}: {stat.value}</div>)}</div>;
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Prompt Codex to render Sales Dashboard stats as simple cards for the sales dashboard.

3. Call the API for Sales Dashboard
   - Explanation Connect to /api/sales with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Sales Dashboard mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/sales', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Sales Dashboard');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Sales Dashboard records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/sales for Sales Dashboard and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Sales Dashboard from /api/sales and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Sales Dashboard component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Sales Dashboard fetch that talks to /api/sales.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Extend the project with a new section (like a detail card) that ties into Sales Dashboard outcomes.
