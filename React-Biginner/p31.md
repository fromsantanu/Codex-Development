# Chapter 31. Protected Pages (Login Required)

## Introduction
- The Protected Pages (Login Required) page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Routing is the hallway map that guides visitors from the lobby to labs without backtracking.
- Protected Pages (Login Required) screens rely on this hallway so a receptionist can jump between summary, list, and detail rooms at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Protected Pages (Login Required) intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Protected Pages (Login Required) is about.
   ```jsx
   function ProtectedPagesLoginIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Protected Pages (Login Required) at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Protected Pages (Login Required) matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the ProtectedPagesLoginIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Protected Pages (Login Required).

2. Route to Protected Pages (Login Required) views
   - Explanation Add quick links so the receptionist can hop between Protected Pages (Login Required) screens without reloading.
   ```jsx
   import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   function ProtectedPagesLoginRouter() {
     return (
       <>
         <nav>
           <Link to='/'>Home</Link>
           <Link to='/details'>Protected Pages (Login Required) Detail</Link>
         </nav>
         <Routes>
           <Route path='/' element={<p>Summary for Protected Pages (Login Required)</p>} />
           <Route path='/details' element={<p>Details for Protected Pages (Login Required)</p>} />
         </Routes>
       </>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Prompt Codex to wire up routes that show Protected Pages (Login Required) summary and detail areas.

3. Call the API for Protected Pages (Login Required)
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Protected Pages (Login Required) mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Protected Pages (Login Required)');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Protected Pages (Login Required) records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Protected Pages (Login Required) and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Protected Pages (Login Required) from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Protected Pages (Login Required) component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Protected Pages (Login Required) fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Add a new route for a Protected Pages (Login Required) cheat sheet and link to it from the nav bar.
