# Chapter 33. Toast Notifications

## Introduction
- The Toast Notifications page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Patterns like modals and tabs feel like telling someone to step into a private consultation room for a moment.
- Toast Notifications benefits from these rituals so the desk person stays in control without clutter at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Toast Notifications intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Toast Notifications is about.
   ```jsx
   function ToastNotificationsIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Toast Notifications at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Toast Notifications matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the ToastNotificationsIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Toast Notifications.

2. Show a Toast Notifications toast notification
   - Explanation Toasts feel like a quick “Done” whisper after a patient check-in.
   ```jsx
   function ToastNotificationsToast() {
     const [shown, setShown] = useState(false);
     useEffect(() => {
       if (shown) {
         const timer = setTimeout(() => setShown(false), 1500);
         return () => clearTimeout(timer);
       }
     }, [shown]);
     return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={() => setShown(true)}>Save Toast Notifications</button>
         {shown && <div className='toast'>Toast Notifications saved!</div>}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Prompt Codex to show a short-lived toast when the Toast Notifications save button is clicked.

3. Call the API for Toast Notifications
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Toast Notifications mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Toast Notifications');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Toast Notifications records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Toast Notifications and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Toast Notifications from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Toast Notifications component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Toast Notifications fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Create a second pattern variant (for example, a second modal or toast) to show how Toast Notifications can adapt.
