# Chapter 20. useEffect – Running Code Automatically

## Introduction
- The Running Code Automatically page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Hooks are like sticky notes that remind the receptionist what to do when a timer or API update happens.
- Running Code Automatically uses hooks just like a nurse relies on a clipboard—simple tools to keep status current at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Running Code Automatically intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Running Code Automatically is about.
   ```jsx
   function RunningCodeAutomaticallyIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Running Code Automatically at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Running Code Automatically matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the RunningCodeAutomaticallyIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Running Code Automatically.

2. Run Running Code Automatically checks with useEffect
   - Explanation useEffect is the morning check that re-runs when the clinic opens so Running Code Automatically stays synced.
   ```jsx
   function RunningCodeAutomaticallyWatcher() {
     useEffect(() => {
       console.log('Checking Running Code Automatically data');
       const timer = setTimeout(() => console.log('Fresh check done'), 0);
       return () => clearTimeout(timer);
     }, []);
     return <p>Running Code Automatically now has its own watcher.</p>;
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Prompt Codex to wrap the Running Code Automatically effect in useEffect so the log fires once when the component mounts.

3. Call the API for Running Code Automatically
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Running Code Automatically mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Running Code Automatically');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Running Code Automatically records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Running Code Automatically and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Running Code Automatically from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Running Code Automatically component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Running Code Automatically fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Add one more hook (like useMemo or another useState) to keep Running Code Automatically logic tidy.
