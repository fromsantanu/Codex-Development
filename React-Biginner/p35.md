# Chapter 35. Accordions

## Introduction
- The Accordions page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Patterns like modals and tabs feel like telling someone to step into a private consultation room for a moment.
- Accordions benefits from these rituals so the desk person stays in control without clutter at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Accordions intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Accordions is about.
   ```jsx
   function AccordionsIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Accordions at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Accordions matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the AccordionsIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Accordions.

2. Open Accordions accordion sections
   - Explanation Accordions let the desk unfold one patient story at a time without crowding the page.
   ```jsx
   function AccordionsAccordion() {
     const [open, setOpen] = useState(null);
     const sections = ['History', 'Notes', 'Actions'];
     return (
       <div>
         {sections.map(section => (
           <div key={section}>
             <button onClick={() => setOpen(open === section ? null : section)}>{section}</button>
             {open === section && <div>{section} for Accordions</div>}
           </div>
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Tell Codex to build the accordion so only one Accordions section stays open at a time.

3. Call the API for Accordions
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Accordions mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Accordions');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Accordions records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Accordions and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Accordions from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Accordions component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Accordions fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Create a second pattern variant (for example, a second modal or toast) to show how Accordions can adapt.
