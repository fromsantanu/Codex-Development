# Chapter 42. UI Libraries

## Introduction
- The UI Libraries page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Polish is the signage and lighting that makes the clinic feel calm on any device.
- UI Libraries deserves the same thoughtful styling so every patient at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk sees a friendly screen.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the UI Libraries intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what UI Libraries is about.
   ```jsx
   function UiLibrariesIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>UI Libraries at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why UI Libraries matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the UiLibrariesIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for UI Libraries.

2. Use a UI library for UI Libraries
   - Explanation UI kits are like branded badges, keeping the clinic palette consistent.
   ```jsx
   import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

   function UiLibrariesLibrary() {
     return <Button variant='contained'>Library button for UI Libraries</Button>;
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to show how a Material UI button looks for the UI Libraries action.

3. Call the API for UI Libraries
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps UI Libraries mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load UI Libraries');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>UI Libraries records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for UI Libraries and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches UI Libraries from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the UI Libraries component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the UI Libraries fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Tweak the styling so UI Libraries stays readable on tiny tablet screens.
