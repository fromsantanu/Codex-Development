# Chapter 15. Building a Table View

## Introduction
- The Building a Table View page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Layouts are the clinic wings that guide people from reception to exam rooms without bumping into each other.
- Building a Table View rows and cards help us compare multiple patients as easily as glancing over the waiting board in Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Building a Table View intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Building a Table View is about.
   ```jsx
   function BuildingATableIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Building a Table View at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Building a Table View matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the BuildingATableIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Building a Table View.

2. Arrange Building a Table View in the grid
   - Explanation Group related Building a Table View pieces into sections so the desk can scan them quickly.
   ```jsx
   function BuildingATableLayout() {
     return (
       <div className='grid gap-3'>
         <section className='card'>Main Building a Table View</section>
         <section className='card'>Side notes for Building a Table View</section>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to wrap Building a Table View parts into two cards inside a grid layout.

3. Call the API for Building a Table View
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Building a Table View mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Building a Table View');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Building a Table View records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Building a Table View and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Building a Table View from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Building a Table View component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Building a Table View fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Add a second column to the layout so Building a Table View insights sit beside quick stats.
