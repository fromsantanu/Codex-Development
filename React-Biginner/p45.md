# Chapter 45. Project 1: Student Management UI

## Introduction
- The Student Management UI page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/students so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Projects stitch everything together like a full patient intake workflow.
- Student Management UI becomes a dependable ritual when the entire front desk UI at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk is tied end-to-end.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Student Management UI intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Student Management UI is about.
   ```jsx
   function StudentManagementUiIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Student Management UI at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Student Management UI matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the StudentManagementUiIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Student Management UI.

2. Show students in the Student Management UI project
   - Explanation Student Management UI needs a list and simple form so staff can add and scan entries.
   ```jsx
   function StudentManagementUiProject() {
     const students = ['Alia', 'Dev'];
     return (
       <div>
         {students.map(name => <p key={name}>{name}</p>)}
         <form>
           <input placeholder='New student' />
         </form>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to pair a student list with a quick form to keep Student Management UI interactive.

3. Call the API for Student Management UI
   - Explanation Connect to /api/students with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Student Management UI mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/students', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Student Management UI');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Student Management UI records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/students for Student Management UI and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Student Management UI from /api/students and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Student Management UI component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Student Management UI fetch that talks to /api/students.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Extend the project with a new section (like a detail card) that ties into Student Management UI outcomes.
