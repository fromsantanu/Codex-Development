# Chapter 43. Responsive Design

## Introduction
- The Responsive Design page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Polish is the signage and lighting that makes the clinic feel calm on any device.
- Responsive Design deserves the same thoughtful styling so every patient at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk sees a friendly screen.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Responsive Design intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Responsive Design is about.
   ```jsx
   function ResponsiveDesignIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Responsive Design at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Responsive Design matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the ResponsiveDesignIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Responsive Design.

2. Make Responsive Design responsive
   - Explanation Responsive styles mean the clinic desk feels right on desktop and tablet alike.
   ```jsx
   function ResponsiveDesignResponsive() {
     return (
       <div className='flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-3'>
         <section className='flex-1'>Left panel for Responsive Design</section>
         <section className='flex-1'>Right panel</section>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Request Codex to wrap Responsive Design panels in responsive flex utility classes.

3. Call the API for Responsive Design
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Responsive Design mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Responsive Design');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Responsive Design records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Responsive Design and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Responsive Design from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Responsive Design component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Responsive Design fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Tweak the styling so Responsive Design stays readable on tiny tablet screens.
