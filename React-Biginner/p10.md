# Chapter 10. Showing Lists of Items

## Introduction
- The Showing Lists of Items page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Buttons and inputs are the buzzers staff tap while telling a patient where to check in.
- Showing Lists of Items stays relatable when each click feels as calm as filling out a check-in slip at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Showing Lists of Items intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Showing Lists of Items is about.
   ```jsx
   function ShowingListsOfIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Showing Lists of Items at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Showing Lists of Items matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the ShowingListsOfIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Showing Lists of Items.

2. Handle Showing Lists of Items interactions
   - Explanation Add a button or input so Showing Lists of Items responds when the receptionist taps or types.
   ```jsx
   function ShowingListsOfButton() {
     const [state, setState] = useState('ready');
     return (
       <button onClick={() => setState(state === 'ready' ? 'sent' : 'ready')}>
         Showing Lists of Items: {state}
       </button>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Prompt Codex to add a Showing Lists of Items button that toggles its label whenever the receptionist clicks it.

3. Call the API for Showing Lists of Items
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Showing Lists of Items mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Showing Lists of Items');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Showing Lists of Items records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Showing Lists of Items and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Showing Lists of Items from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Showing Lists of Items component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Showing Lists of Items fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Introduce a mini filter or toggle that changes how Showing Lists of Items buttons behave on the page.
