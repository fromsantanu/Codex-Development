# Chapter 28. File Upload UI

## Introduction
- The File Upload UI page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/uploads so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Fetching data is sliding a folder from the records clerk to the desk so everyone sees the latest notes.
- File Upload UI is the reason our frontend talks to the API, pulling new arrivals and sending updates without extra clicks.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the File Upload UI intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what File Upload UI is about.
   ```jsx
   function FileUploadUiIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>File Upload UI at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why File Upload UI matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the FileUploadUiIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for File Upload UI.

2. Display File Upload UI data
   - Explanation Map over sample records so File Upload UI looks like live data from the API.
   ```jsx
   const sampleRecords = [
     { id: '1', label: 'Maya' },
     { id: '2', label: 'Dev' }
   ];
   function FileUploadUiList() {
     return (
       <div>
         {sampleRecords.map(record => (
           <article key={record.id}>
             <strong>{record.label}</strong>
             <p>File Upload UI note</p>
           </article>
         ))}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Let Codex format those sample records into cards so File Upload UI looks ready for real data.

3. Call the API for File Upload UI
   - Explanation Connect to /api/uploads with POST so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps File Upload UI mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const formData = new FormData();
       formData.append('file', new Blob(['summary'], { type: 'text/plain' }));
       const response = await fetch('/api/uploads', {
         method: 'POST',
         body: formData,
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load File Upload UI');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>File Upload UI records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/uploads for File Upload UI and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches File Upload UI from /api/uploads and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the File Upload UI component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the File Upload UI fetch that talks to /api/uploads.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Wire a small filter that lets you call /api/uploads with a query so you can see subsets of File Upload UI.
