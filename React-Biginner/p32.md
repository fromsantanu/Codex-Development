# Chapter 32. Modal Windows

## Introduction
- The Modal Windows page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Patterns like modals and tabs feel like telling someone to step into a private consultation room for a moment.
- Modal Windows benefits from these rituals so the desk person stays in control without clutter at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Modal Windows intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Modal Windows is about.
   ```jsx
   function ModalWindowsIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Modal Windows at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Modal Windows matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the ModalWindowsIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Modal Windows.

2. Open a Modal Windows modal
   - Explanation A modal feels like asking someone to step into the exam room quickly, perfect for Modal Windows details.
   ```jsx
   function ModalWindowsModal() {
     const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
     return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>View Modal Windows</button>
         {open && (
           <div className='modal'>
             <p>Modal has Modal Windows essentials.</p>
             <button onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>Close</button>
           </div>
         )}
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to create the modal toggle button for Modal Windows so it opens and closes cleanly.

3. Call the API for Modal Windows
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Modal Windows mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Modal Windows');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Modal Windows records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Modal Windows and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Modal Windows from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Modal Windows component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Modal Windows fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Create a second pattern variant (for example, a second modal or toast) to show how Modal Windows can adapt.
