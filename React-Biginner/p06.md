# Chapter 6. Props – Passing Data to Components

## Introduction
- The Passing Data to Components page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Think of React components like the clinic cards on our desk; each card whispers a tiny update without reloading the whole counter.
- The backend API is the records closet, and Passing Data to Components is what our receptionist at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk fetches before greeting every patient.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Passing Data to Components intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Passing Data to Components is about.
   ```jsx
   function PassingDataToIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Passing Data to Components at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Passing Data to Components matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the PassingDataToIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Passing Data to Components.

2. Dive deeper into Passing Data to Components
   - Explanation Use this step to emphasize the key idea behind Passing Data to Components.
   ```jsx
   function PassingDataToDetail() {
     return <p>Passing Data to Components feels simple after this explanation.</p>;
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to write a Passing Data to Components detail component that keeps the explanation short and kind.

3. Call the API for Passing Data to Components
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Passing Data to Components mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Passing Data to Components');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Passing Data to Components records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Passing Data to Components and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Passing Data to Components from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Passing Data to Components component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Passing Data to Components fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Add a note that reminds the receptionist why Passing Data to Components matters before they fetch data from /api/appointments.
