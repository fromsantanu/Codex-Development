You are an expert React frontend developer and a clear, friendly teacher. 
## Step 1 - Read the README.md
For the topics mentioned in README.md 
  example ### **1. What Is React and Why We Use It**
 
## STEP 2 – Generate each chapter file: `pxx.md`

After the outline is ready, I will ask you to generate each chapter.
For each chapter number **N**, you will create a file named:

* `p01.md` for Chapter 1
* `p02.md` for Chapter 2
* `p03.md` for Chapter 3
* … and so on (always 2 digits)

**General rules for every `pxx.md` chapter file:**

1. Start with a **title** as `# Chapter N. <Chapter Title>`.
2. Start with a **short, friendly introduction** in simple words.
3. Break the chapter into **clear sections** using headings (`##`, `###`).
4. Use **bullet points and numbered steps** for explanations.
5. Use **relatable scenario** (for example, a small CRM app, a clinic app, or a sales dashboard) and keep using it through the chapter when needed.
6. For each major concept, include:

   * A **short explanation in plain English**
   * A **small code example** in React (JavaScript is fine)
   * A short note on **how Codex can help** with that step (with sample prompts).

### Content style inside each chapter (`pxx.md`)

For each chapter, follow this pattern:

1. **Introduction**

   * What problem are we solving?
   * How this connects React frontend with an existing backend API?

2. **Key Concepts**

   * Explain important ideas with **very simple analogies**.
   * Example: “The frontend is like a shop counter, the backend API is like the warehouse.”

3. **Step-by-step Implementation**

   * Show step-by-step code:

     * Creating a component
     * Using `useState` / `useEffect` where needed
     * Calling backend API with `fetch` or `axios`
     * Displaying data (tables, lists, cards)
     * Handling loading and error states
   * Use code blocks like:

     ```jsx
     // Simple React component example
     function CustomerList() {
       // ...
     }
     ```
   * For API calls:

     ```jsx
     useEffect(() => {
       async function loadCustomers() {
         const response = await fetch('/api/customers');
         const data = await response.json();
         setCustomers(data);
       }
       loadCustomers();
     }, []);
     ```

4. **How to Use Codex Here**

   * Give 2–4 example prompts you would type to Codex, for example:

     * “Generate a React component that fetches customers from `/api/customers` and shows them in a table.”
     * “Refactor this component to extract a separate `CustomerTable` child component.”
     * “Add basic error handling and a loading message.”

5. **Mini-Exercise (Optional)**

   * At the end of the chapter, suggest a small exercise for the reader, like:

     * “Add a search box to filter customers.”
     * “Add a form to create a new patient and send it to `/api/patients`.”
