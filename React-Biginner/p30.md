# Chapter 30. Creating Multiple Pages

## Introduction
- The Creating Multiple Pages page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Routing is the hallway map that guides visitors from the lobby to labs without backtracking.
- Creating Multiple Pages screens rely on this hallway so a receptionist can jump between summary, list, and detail rooms at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Creating Multiple Pages intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Creating Multiple Pages is about.
   ```jsx
   function CreatingMultiplePagesIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Creating Multiple Pages at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Creating Multiple Pages matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the CreatingMultiplePagesIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Creating Multiple Pages.

2. Route to Creating Multiple Pages views
   - Explanation Add quick links so the receptionist can hop between Creating Multiple Pages screens without reloading.
   ```jsx
   import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   function CreatingMultiplePagesRouter() {
     return (
       <>
         <nav>
           <Link to='/'>Home</Link>
           <Link to='/details'>Creating Multiple Pages Detail</Link>
         </nav>
         <Routes>
           <Route path='/' element={<p>Summary for Creating Multiple Pages</p>} />
           <Route path='/details' element={<p>Details for Creating Multiple Pages</p>} />
         </Routes>
       </>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Prompt Codex to wire up routes that show Creating Multiple Pages summary and detail areas.

3. Call the API for Creating Multiple Pages
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Creating Multiple Pages mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Creating Multiple Pages');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Creating Multiple Pages records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Creating Multiple Pages and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Creating Multiple Pages from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Creating Multiple Pages component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Creating Multiple Pages fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Add a new route for a Creating Multiple Pages cheat sheet and link to it from the nav bar.
