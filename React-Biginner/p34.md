# Chapter 34. Tabs

## Introduction
- The Tabs page helps the Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk team handle the clinic flow without confusion.
- The React front end calls /api/appointments so this screen stays in sync with the backend API.

## Key Concepts
- Patterns like modals and tabs feel like telling someone to step into a private consultation room for a moment.
- Tabs benefits from these rituals so the desk person stays in control without clutter at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk.

## Step-by-step Implementation
1. Lay out the Tabs intro card
   - Explanation Start with a friendly section so the Sunrise Clinic desk knows what Tabs is about.
   ```jsx
   function TabsIntro() {
     return (
       <section className='intro-card'>
         <h2>Tabs at Sunrise Clinic Scheduling Desk</h2>
         <p>Welcome back, front desk! This section explains why Tabs matters today.</p>
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to build the TabsIntro section with a warm heading and short explanation for Tabs.

2. Switch Tabs tabs
   - Explanation Tabs are like numbered stations at the clinic where staff pick the right station for the job.
   ```jsx
   function TabsTabs() {
     const [tab, setTab] = useState('summary');
     return (
       <div>
         <nav>
           <button onClick={() => setTab('summary')}>Summary</button>
           <button onClick={() => setTab('details')}>Details</button>
         </nav>
         <section>{tab === 'summary' ? 'Summary for Tabs' : 'Details for Tabs'}</section>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to toggle Tabs content between summary and detail tabs using buttons.

3. Call the API for Tabs
   - Explanation Connect to /api/appointments with GET so the sunrise clinic frontend keeps Tabs mirrored with the backend.
   ```jsx
   const [records, setRecords] = useState([]);
   useEffect(() => {
     async function syncData() {
       const response = await fetch('/api/appointments', {
         method: 'GET',
       });
       if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to load Tabs');
       const data = await response.json();
       setRecords(data);
     }
     syncData();
   }, []);
   return <p>Tabs records: {records.length}</p>;
   ```
   - Codex help: Ask Codex to craft the fetch block that calls /api/appointments for Tabs and stores the result.

## How to Use Codex Here
- Generate a React component that fetches Tabs from /api/appointments and lists it in friendly cards.
- Refactor the Tabs component so it splits the header and list parts into child components.
- Add loading and error messages for the Tabs fetch that talks to /api/appointments.

## Mini-Exercise (Optional)
- Create a second pattern variant (for example, a second modal or toast) to show how Tabs can adapt.
