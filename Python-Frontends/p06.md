# **Chapter 6. API Basics for Frontend Developers**

## **1. Simple Introduction**

When your frontend UI needs data, it must “talk” to the backend.
This talking happens through **APIs**.

Think of an API as a **waiter** in a restaurant.
The UI (customer) tells the waiter what it wants.
The backend (kitchen) prepares it.
The waiter returns with the result.

In software, this communication happens over **HTTP** and uses simple rules.
These rules are called **API Basics**.

---

## **2. Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine you run a **shop**:

* Want to **see items**? → Ask the shopkeeper.
* Want to **add a new item**? → Tell the shopkeeper to add one.
* Want to **update an existing item**? → Tell the shopkeeper to modify it.
* Want to **remove an item**? → Ask the shopkeeper to delete it.

APIs work the same way using **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**.

## **3. Key Concepts (Explained Gently)**

### **1) HTTP Methods (the main actions)**

These are like actions you perform in a shop:

| Method     | Simple Meaning         | Shop Example               |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **GET**    | Ask for information    | “Show me all items”        |
| **POST**   | Add something new      | “Add this new product”     |
| **PUT**    | Update something fully | “Change item price to 200” |
| **DELETE** | Remove something       | “Delete item ID 5”         |

---

### **2) URL (Address of the resource)**

A URL is like the **shelf location** in a shop.

Example:

```
https://api.myshop.com/items/12
```

Means “Go to item number 12.”

---

### **3) Headers (Extra instructions)**

Headers are small notes you give to the shopkeeper.

Example:

* “I am sending JSON.”
* “I am logged in.”
* “Here is my API key.”

---

### **4) Body (The content you send)**

When you add or update something, the details go inside the **body**.

Like writing on a slip:
“Name: Shoes, Price: 800.”

---

### **5) Status Code (Backend’s reply status)**

This tells you if your request was successful.

| Code    | Meaning        |
| ------- | -------------- |
| **200** | OK             |
| **201** | Created        |
| **400** | Bad request    |
| **401** | Unauthorized   |
| **404** | Not found      |
| **500** | Server problem |

---

### **6) JSON (The data packet)**

JSON is the language frontend and backend use to exchange data.

It is like a **small, neatly packed parcel** with labels.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Shoes",
  "price": 800,
  "in_stock": true
}
```

JSON is simple, readable, and works everywhere.

## **4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **Step 1: UI wants something**

A button click → “Get all items”.

### **Step 2: Send an HTTP request**

Use `GET` to fetch data.

### **Step 3: Backend sends JSON**

The backend responds with a JSON list of items.

### **Step 4: UI displays the result**

The frontend shows the items in a table.

## **5. Example UI Code (Streamlit)**

### **Simple GET API call**

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

st.title("Shop Item Viewer")

if st.button("Get Items"):
    response = requests.get("https://dummyjson.com/products")
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        st.json(data)
    else:
        st.error("Failed to load data")
```

### **POST API call (add new item)**

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

name = st.text_input("Item name")
price = st.number_input("Price")

if st.button("Add Item"):
    payload = {"name": name, "price": price}

    res = requests.post("https://example.com/items", json=payload)
    
    if res.status_code == 201:
        st.success("Item added!")
    else:
        st.error("Could not add item")
```

## **6. Simple Backend API Example (FastAPI)**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/items")
def get_items():
    return [{"id": 1, "name": "Shoes"}]

@app.post("/items")
def add_item(item: dict):
    return {"message": "Created", "item": item}
```

## **8. Mini Exercises for Students**

### ✔️ Exercise 1

Create a Streamlit interface with a button to **GET** data from:
`https://dummyjson.com/users`

### ✔️ Exercise 2

Add a simple **POST** request to send a message to:
`https://httpbin.org/post`

Show the response JSON on screen.

### ✔️ Exercise 3

Create four buttons: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (dummy calls).
Display the status code for each.
