# **Chapter 5: Basic Tools Setup**

---

## **1. Simple Introduction**

Before we start building frontends with Python and using Codex, we need a clean setup:

* Python environment
* Streamlit / Gradio / NiceGUI installed
* Environment variables ready
* Codex connected to VS Code or CLI

Think of this chapter as **setting up your work desk** before you start building anything.

---

## **2. Real-Life Analogy: “Setting Up Your Tools Before Cooking”**

Before cooking:

* you wash the utensils
* prepare the ingredients
* switch on the gas
* keep everything within reach

Only then you start cooking.

Similarly, in software development:

* install Python packages
* create a clean workspace
* set API keys
* connect Codex

Once the setup is ready, building apps becomes easy.

## **3. Key Concepts (Explained Gently)**

### **Python Environment**

A clean folder where all your project’s packages stay separate.

### **virtualenv**

A small “container” that keeps your project’s Python libraries isolated.

### **Environment Variables**

Secret values (like API keys) stored safely in your system.

### **Codex in VS Code / CLI**

Tools that let you use Codex to generate code directly.

---

## **4. Step-by-Step: Setting Up Python Environment**

### **Step 1: Check Python Installation**

Open terminal and run:

```
python --version
```

Version should be **3.10+**.

---

### **Step 2: Create a Project Folder**

```
mkdir frontend-codex
cd frontend-codex
```

---

### **Step 3: Create Virtual Environment**

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

* **Windows**

  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **Linux/Mac**

  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

You should now see `(venv)` before your terminal prompt.

---

## **5. Installing Streamlit / Gradio / NiceGUI**

Install all three so you can switch easily.

```
pip install streamlit gradio nicegui
```

Also install **requests** for API calls:

```
pip install requests
```

Optional but useful:

```
pip install httpx
```

---

## **6. Setting Environment Variables for API Keys**

Environment variables hide your secret keys so you never write them inside code.

Example (Windows PowerShell):

```
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-key-here"
```

Linux/Mac:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

You can check:

```
echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%     (Windows)
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY      (Linux/Mac)
```

### **Why environment variables?**

Because writing keys in code is risky — anyone who sees your file can misuse them.

## **7. Connecting Codex in VS Code**

### **Step 1: Install VS Code**

Download from official site.

---

### **Step 2: Install the OpenAI Extension**

In VS Code:

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+X`
* Search **OpenAI**
* Install the extension

---

### **Step 3: Add Your API Key**

* Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
* Search: **OpenAI: Set API Key**
* Paste your key

---

### **Step 4: Use Codex to Generate UI Code**

Open a Python file → Write a comment like:

```python
# Create a Streamlit form with name, age, and submit button
```

Then ask Codex:

```
Generate code
```

Codex will create the UI automatically.

---

## **8. Using Codex CLI for UI Code Generation**

If you prefer command line:

Install:

```
npm install -g openai
```

Then login:

```
openai login
```

Now you can generate code from the terminal:

```
openai codex generate -p "Create a Streamlit form with name, age, and submit button"
```

You can also generate complete files:

```
openai codex generate -i app.py -o app_new.py
```

Codex will read your current file and improve it.

## **9. Simple Diagram**

```
Your Computer
     │
     │ Python + virtualenv
     ▼
Project Folder
     │
     ├── Streamlit / Gradio / NiceGUI installed
     ├── Environment variables set
     └── Codex (VS Code / CLI) connected
```

Once this setup is ready → You can build any frontend.

---

## **10. How Codex Helps You Here**

Codex can:

* install dependencies
* generate the initial “app.py”
* create folders and UI skeletons
* write API-call code
* fix version issues
* suggest correct imports
* refactor your messy setup

### **Sample Prompts**

#### **Prompt 1**

“Create a Streamlit dashboard project structure with pages and components.”

#### **Prompt 2**

“Install required packages and generate a starter app.py for NiceGUI.”

#### **Prompt 3**

“Fix dependency conflict in my requirements.txt.”

#### **Prompt 4**

“Generate a Gradio interface for login + connecting to backend.”

## **11. Mini Exercises for Students**

### **Exercise 1**

Create a new virtual environment and install:

* streamlit
* requests
* nicegui

---

### **Exercise 2**

Set an environment variable:

`MY_SECRET = "hello123"`

Then print it inside Python.

---

### **Exercise 3**

Ask Codex in VS Code:

> “Generate a basic Streamlit app with a textbox and button.”

Run and test it.
