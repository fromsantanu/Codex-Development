# **Chapter 47. Writing Documentation for Frontend Users**

## **1. Simple Introduction**

When you create a frontend app—like a customer list, clinic dashboard, or sales tool—people who use it need clear instructions.
They should know:

* **How to install it**
* **How to run it**
* **How to use each screen**
* **Which backend APIs it talks to**

Good documentation is like giving someone a small guidebook so they don’t get lost.

This chapter will teach you how to write **a simple README**, **a short user guide**, and **a small API usage section**.

## **2. Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine you bought a new washing machine.

If it comes **without the manual**, you may not understand:

* Which button starts the wash
* How to select water level
* What to do if there's an error

Frontend documentation is exactly like that manual.
It helps your users feel confident while using the system.

---

## **3. Key Concepts (Explained Gently)**

### **README**

A small file (usually `README.md`) that explains:

* What this app does
* How to install and run it
* Basic usage

### **User Guide**

A more detailed explanation of **each screen**, often with images.

### **API Usage Section**

Explains *which backend endpoints the UI calls*, so developers understand the data flow.

---

## **4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **Step 1: Create a Simple README File**

A good README has 5 parts:

1. **Title**
2. **What this app does (in 4–5 lines)**
3. **Installation steps**
4. **How to run the app**
5. **Basic usage instructions**

Here is a tiny example:

```markdown
# Clinic Frontend

A simple NiceGUI-based frontend for viewing patients and adding new visit details.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run
python main.py

## Features
- List patients
- Search by name
- Add new visit
```

---

### **Step 2: Add a Short User Guide with Screenshots**

Screenshots make everything easy to understand.

Example structure:

```markdown
# User Guide

## Home Page
This page shows all patients.
![screenshot-home](screens/home.png)

## Add Patient
Enter details and click Save.
![screenshot-add](screens/add_patient.png)
```

Explain each screen in very simple language.

---

### **Step 3: Add an API Usage Section**

This tells users which backend APIs the frontend communicates with.

Example:

```markdown
# API Usage

## 1. Get all patients
GET /patients

## 2. Add new patient
POST /patients
Body:
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 45,
  "disease": "Diabetes"
}

## 3. Get visit history
GET /patients/{id}/visits
```

Keep it short and readable.

---

### **Step 4: Organize Documentation in Folders**

A clean structure helps others navigate easily.

```
project/
│
├─ README.md
├─ USER_GUIDE.md
├─ API_USAGE.md
└─ screens/
     ├─ home.png
     ├─ add_patient.png
     └─ visit_details.png
```

---

### **Step 5: Keep Updating Documentation**

Whenever you add a new feature:

* Update README
* Add a screenshot
* Add the new API being used

Documentation is **not one-time work**.
It grows as your app grows.

---

## **5. Example Code Snippet (Streamlit)**

```python
import streamlit as st
import requests

st.title("Patient List")

response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/patients")
patients = response.json()

for p in patients:
    st.write(f"{p['name']} - {p['age']} years")
```

In the README, explain this in 2–3 lines:
“This page fetches the patient list using GET /patients.”

---

## **6. Example Backend API (Simple)**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Rita Sharma",
    "age": 37,
    "disease": "Hypertension"
  }
]
```

Add JSON examples like this in the API usage section.

## **7. How Codex Can Help Here**

Here are simple prompt examples:

1. **“Write a beginner-friendly README.md for a NiceGUI frontend that calls three APIs: list patients, add patient, get visits.”**
2. **“Generate USER_GUIDE.md with sections for Home Page, Add Patient, and Visit Details.”**
3. **“Write API_USAGE.md explaining all backend endpoints my UI uses.”**
4. **“Improve my README formatting and add missing steps.”**
5. **“Create markdown diagrams showing frontend → API → database flow.”**

Codex can also rewrite long documents into simple language.

## **8. Mini Exercises for Students**

### **Exercise 1**

Create a README for a simple “Sales Dashboard” built in Streamlit.

### **Exercise 2**

Add one screenshot and write a short User Guide for any one page of your UI.

### **Exercise 3**

Create an API Usage section for a dummy API:

* `/sales`
* `/sales/{id}`
* `/sales/monthly-summary`
