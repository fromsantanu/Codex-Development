# **Chapter 16. Dashboard Basics – Showing Data Clearly**

## **1. Simple Introduction**

A **dashboard** is just a screen that shows the most important information in one place.
Think of it like opening a single page and immediately understanding:

* What is happening?
* What needs attention?
* What actions you may need to take?

Dashboards help users avoid searching through many pages. Everything they need is visible at a glance.

---

## **2. Real-Life Analogy**

Imagine a **car dashboard**.

When you drive, you don’t open a long list of menus.
You simply look at:

* Speed
* Fuel level
* Engine alerts
* Indicators

All the important things are right in front of you.

A **software dashboard** works the same way.
It shows the most important data clearly, without making the user think too much.

---

## **3. Key Concepts (Explained Gently)**

### ✔️ **Cards**

Small boxes that show key numbers.
Examples:

* Total patients today
* Sales this month
* Number of pending tasks

These are like small notice boards.

---

### ✔️ **Tables**

A list of items in rows and columns.
Examples:

* Patient list
* Orders
* Transactions

Tables are useful when you need detailed info.

---

### ✔️ **Charts**

Visual shapes that make data easy to understand.
Examples:

* Bar chart
* Line chart
* Pie chart

Charts help you “see” patterns quickly.

---

### ✔️ **Filters**

Simple selections that help users choose what they want to see.
Examples:

* Date range
* Category
* Status: Active / Closed / Pending

Filters help clean up the dashboard and reduce clutter.

---

### ✔️ **Choosing What Matters**

A good dashboard does *not* show everything.
It shows only what the user needs **right now**.

Like a doctor dashboard may show:

* Patients waiting
* Critical cases
* Appointment schedule
* Today’s earnings

Think from the user’s point of view.

## **4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

**Step 1: Decide who the dashboard is for**
Doctor? Admin? Student? Manager?
Each will need different information.

---

**Step 2: Choose 3–4 key numbers (cards)**
Pick the most important KPIs (“key performance indicators”).

---

**Step 3: Add 1 table**
Keep it simple: show the main list (appointments, sales, tasks).

---

**Step 4: Add 1 chart**
Choose the one that best explains the pattern.

---

**Step 5: Add filters**
Date filters are the most common.

---

**Step 6: Keep the layout clean**
Do not add too many elements.
White space is good—it keeps the design breathable.

---

## **5. Example UI Code (Using Streamlit)**

Here is a small, clean dashboard using **Streamlit**:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt

st.title("Simple Clinic Dashboard")

# --- Filters ---
date_filter = st.date_input("Choose a date")

# --- Cards ---
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
col1.metric("Patients Today", 18)
col2.metric("New Registrations", 4)
col3.metric("Pending Follow-ups", 6)

# --- Table ---
data = {
    "Name": ["Rita", "Amit", "John"],
    "Status": ["Waiting", "In Progress", "Completed"],
    "Time": ["10:30", "11:00", "11:30"]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
st.subheader("Patient List")
st.table(df)

# --- Chart ---
chart_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'day': ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri'],
    'patients': [12, 18, 20, 15, 22]
})
chart = alt.Chart(chart_data).mark_bar().encode(
    x='day',
    y='patients'
)
st.subheader("Patients Over the Week")
st.altair_chart(chart, use_container_width=True)
```

This shows:

* cards
* table
* chart
* date filter

Simple, clean, easy for beginners.

## **6. Backend API Example (Simple)**

A dashboard usually fetches data like this:

### **Request**

```
GET /api/dashboard/today
```

### **Response**

```json
{
  "patients_today": 18,
  "new_registrations": 4,
  "pending_followups": 6,
  "patient_list": [
    {"name": "Rita", "status": "Waiting"},
    {"name": "Amit", "status": "In Progress"}
  ],
  "weekly_data": [
    {"day": "Mon", "patients": 12},
    {"day": "Tue", "patients": 18}
  ]
}
```

Your frontend reads this JSON and fills the cards, tables, and charts.

## **7. How Codex Can Help Here**

Here are sample prompts students can use:

### ✔️ Prompt 1: Generate a dashboard layout

**“Codex, create a simple Streamlit dashboard with three metric cards, one table, and one bar chart. Use dummy data.”**

### ✔️ Prompt 2: Connect dashboard to backend API

**“Codex, add a `requests.get()` call to fetch data from `/api/dashboard/today` and update the dashboard values.”**

### ✔️ Prompt 3: Add filters

**“Codex, add a date filter to the dashboard and send the selected date to the backend API.”**

### ✔️ Prompt 4: Improve the design

**“Codex, please refactor this dashboard code to make the layout cleaner and more readable.”**

### ✔️ Prompt 5: Debugging

**“Codex, fix errors in this Streamlit dashboard and explain what went wrong.”**

## **8. Mini Exercises for Students**

Try these small tasks:

### 🟦 **Task 1**

Create a dashboard with two cards:

* Total sales today
* Total refunds today

Use dummy numbers.

---

### 🟦 **Task 2**

Add a table showing *5 recent orders* with columns:

* Order ID
* Amount
* Status

---

### 🟦 **Task 3**

Add a filter that chooses **category** and update the table using `df[df["category"] == selected]`.
