# **Chapter 38. Basic Layout Principles for Business Apps**

---

## **1. Simple Introduction**

When you build a business app—like a hospital form, a sales dashboard, or a booking screen—the layout matters a lot.
A clean layout makes the user feel relaxed and confident.
A messy layout makes the user confused and slows them down.

In this chapter, we learn a few easy layout rules that make your app look professional even if you are not a designer.

## **2. Real-Life Analogy**

Think of a **doctor’s clinic reception desk**.

* Forms are grouped: personal info, medical info, payment info.
* Important buttons (like “Submit”) are always in the same place.
* Headings are clear: “Patient Details”, “Symptoms”, “Doctor’s Notes”.

A good business app should feel the same — neat, predictable, and easy to scan.

## **3. Key Concepts (Explained Gently)**

### **1. Group Related Inputs Together**

Put similar fields in the same box/section.
Example: All patient contact fields together (phone, email, address).

### **2. Clear Headings and Sections**

Before a group of inputs, place a small heading like **“Personal Details”**.

### **3. Consistent Button Positions**

Users should always find the main button at the same position — usually:

* Right side (bottom-right)
* Or full-width at bottom

This builds habit and reduces mistakes.

## **4. Step-by-Step Explanation**

### **Step 1: Divide your screen**

Think of your app screen like small rooms in a house:

```
Page
 ├── Section 1: Basic Info
 ├── Section 2: Details
 └── Section 3: Actions (Buttons)
```

### **Step 2: Add headings**

Use short, clear titles:

* “Customer Info”
* “Product Details”
* “Billing Section”

### **Step 3: Group similar fields**

If you have 10 inputs, don’t list them in one long column.
Break them into chunks of 3–4 inputs.

### **Step 4: Keep the ‘Save’ or ‘Submit’ button predictable**

Place it:

```
[Submit]   → bottom-right
```

or

```
---------------------------
|     Submit Button       |
---------------------------
```

### **Step 5: Keep spacing consistent**

Use equal spacing between sections.
This makes the UI look clean and professional.

## **5. Example UI Code (Using NiceGUI)**

Here is a very beginner-friendly example:

```python
from nicegui import ui

def page():
    ui.label("Customer Registration").classes("text-xl font-bold")

    with ui.card():
        ui.label("Personal Details").classes("text-lg")
        ui.input("Full Name")
        ui.input("Email")
        ui.input("Phone Number")

    with ui.card():
        ui.label("Address Details").classes("text-lg")
        ui.input("Street")
        ui.input("City")
        ui.input("Postal Code")

    with ui.row().classes("justify-end w-full"):
        ui.button("Save").classes("bg-blue-600 text-white")

ui.page("/", page)

ui.run()
```

### What this example shows:

* Inputs grouped inside cards
* Clear headings
* Button placed at the bottom-right

## **6. Backend API Example (Simple)**

A simple POST request you would send from this form:

### **Request (JSON)**

```json
{
  "full_name": "Amit Sharma",
  "email": "amit@example.com",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "address": {
    "street": "Park Street",
    "city": "Kolkata",
    "postal_code": "700016"
  }
}
```

### **Response**

```json
{
  "message": "Customer saved successfully"
}
```
