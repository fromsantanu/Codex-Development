# Chapter 6. Types, Fields & Scalars

---

## 1. Simple Heading

**Types, Fields, and Scalars – “What kind of data is this?”**

---

## 2. Short Introduction

In GraphQL, **everything is about types**.

* A **type** is like a data shape (e.g., `Student`, `Course`, `Invoice`).
* A **field** is like a column or property (e.g., `name`, `age`, `price`).
* A **scalar** is a basic value like text, number, or true/false.

GraphQL comes with some built-in scalar types:

* `String` – text
* `Int` – whole number
* `Float` – decimal number
* `Boolean` – true/false
* `ID` – special identifier, usually a string used as an ID

Once you understand types, fields, and scalars, the schema starts to feel very natural.

## 3. Use-case Story – Hospital Registration Form

Imagine a **hospital registration desk**.

When a new patient comes, the receptionist fills a form:

* Name: “Ravi Kumar” → text → `String`
* Age: 45 → whole number → `Int`
* Height: 172.5 cm → decimal → `Float`
* Is admitted: yes/no → `Boolean`
* Patient ID: “P-2025-00123” → identifier → `ID`

If we model this in GraphQL:

* `Patient` is a **type**.
* `name`, `age`, `height`, `isAdmitted`, `id` are **fields**.
* `String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `ID` are **scalars**.

So the **registration form in real life** becomes a **type definition in GraphQL**.

---

## 4. Code Examples

### 4.1 Basic Scalars

These are the most common built-in scalar types:

* `String`: `"Hello"`, `"Ravi Kumar"`
* `Int`: `10`, `45`, `2025`
* `Float`: `99.5`, `172.75`
* `Boolean`: `true`, `false`
* `ID`: `"123"`, `"P-2025-00123"` (usually a string, can be numeric too)

### 4.2 Defining a Simple Type with Scalars

Let’s define a `Patient` type using these scalars:

```graphql
# A patient in a hospital system
type Patient {
  id: ID!            # Unique identifier for the patient
  name: String!      # Full name
  age: Int           # Age in years (can be null if unknown)
  heightCm: Float    # Height in centimeters
  isAdmitted: Boolean! # Is the patient currently admitted?
}
```

Notes:

* `!` means **non-null** (must have a value).
* Without `!`, the value can be `null`.

### 4.3 Lists of Types (Arrays)

Now suppose a patient can have multiple phone numbers.

```graphql
type Patient {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  phoneNumbers: [String!]! 
  # List of phone numbers. The list itself is never null,
  # and each phone number inside the list is a non-null String.
}
```

* `[String]` = list (array) of `String` values.
* `[String!]!` = list is non-null, each item is non-null.

### 4.4 JSON → GraphQL Type Example

Very common use-case:

You already have some **JSON data** from an API or database.
You want to convert it into a GraphQL **type**.

**Example JSON – student record**

```json
{
  "id": "stu_101",
  "full_name": "Amit Singh",
  "age": 21,
  "gpa": 8.4,
  "is_active": true
}
```

We can design a GraphQL type like this:

```graphql
# Represents a student in the system
type Student {
  id: ID!          # "stu_101"
  fullName: String!  # "Amit Singh" (camelCase field name)
  age: Int         # 21
  gpa: Float       # 8.4
  isActive: Boolean! # true
}
```

Notice:

* We changed `full_name` → `fullName` (camelCase is common in GraphQL).
* We used **proper scalars** based on JSON values.
* We used `ID!` for `id`, even though it is a string, because it behaves like an identifier.

### 4.5 Nested Types from JSON

**Example JSON – course with nested teacher**

```json
{
  "course_id": "CSE101",
  "title": "Intro to Programming",
  "credit_hours": 4,
  "is_active": true,
  "teacher": {
    "id": "T-7",
    "name": "Dr. Mehta",
    "email": "mehta@example.com"
  }
}
```

We can define two types: `Course` and `Teacher`.

```graphql
type Teacher {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Course {
  id: ID!          # from course_id
  title: String!
  creditHours: Int!
  isActive: Boolean!
  teacher: Teacher!  # nested object
}
```

We:

* Converted `course_id` → `id` (`ID!`).
* Converted `credit_hours` → `creditHours` (`Int!`).
* Turned `teacher` object into its own **type** (`Teacher`).

This is how you **go from JSON to GraphQL types**.

## 5. Diagram – How Types and Fields Fit In

```text
GraphQL Schema
    |
    +-- Scalar Types (basic building blocks)
    |       - String
    |       - Int
    |       - Float
    |       - Boolean
    |       - ID
    |
    +-- Object Types (your business data)
            - Patient
            - Student
            - Course
            - Invoice
            ...
            Each object type
              |
              +-- Fields (with scalar or object types)
                    name: String
                    age: Int
                    isAdmitted: Boolean
                    teacher: Teacher
                    ...
```

Think of scalars as **bricks**, object types as **rooms**, and the whole schema as the **building plan**.

## 6. “How to Instruct Codex” Prompts

Here are some ready prompts you can use with Codex to speed up work.

### 6.1 From JSON to GraphQL Type

> “Given this JSON example, suggest a GraphQL type definition with proper field types and names. Use String, Int, Float, Boolean, and ID where appropriate. Also, convert snake_case keys to camelCase:
>
> ````json
> {
>   "id": "stu_101",
>   "full_name": "Amit Singh",
>   "age": 21,
>   "gpa": 8.4,
>   "is_active": true
> }
> ```”
> ````

### 6.2 Nested JSON to Multiple Types

> “Given this JSON, generate GraphQL type definitions. Use separate types for nested objects, pick appropriate scalar types, and use camelCase for field names:
>
> ````json
> {
>   "course_id": "CSE101",
>   "title": "Intro to Programming",
>   "credit_hours": 4,
>   "is_active": true,
>   "teacher": {
>     "id": "T-7",
>     "name": "Dr. Mehta",
>     "email": "mehta@example.com"
>   }
> }
> ```”
> ````

### 6.3 Review and Improve Existing Types

> “Here are some GraphQL type definitions:
>
> ```graphql
> [PASTE YOUR TYPES HERE]
> ```
>
> Please review and improve:
>
> * Pick better field names if needed
> * Use proper scalars (String, Int, Float, Boolean, ID)
> * Add comments in plain English for each field.”

### 6.4 Add Non-Null and List Modifiers

> “Here is my GraphQL type:
>
> ```graphql
> [PASTE TYPE HERE]
> ```
>
> Suggest where I should use non-null `!` and list types `[]` based on typical usage (e.g., name should not be null, an order has a list of items, etc.). Explain the changes in simple language.”

## 7. Summary

1. **Types** describe shapes of data (like `Student`, `Course`, `Patient`), and **fields** are the properties of those types.
2. **Scalars** (`String`, `Int`, `Float`, `Boolean`, `ID`) are the basic value types used to build your object types.
3. You can easily turn real-world JSON into GraphQL types, and Codex can help you **suggest field names, choose scalars, and add comments** in plain English.
