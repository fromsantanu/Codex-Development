# **Chapter 31. How to Ask Codex for Code**

*Helping Codex understand exactly what you want*

---

### **Short Introduction**

When you talk to Codex, think of it like talking to a helper in your office who writes code for you.
If your instructions are clear, it works beautifully.
If your instructions are vague, it gets confused—just like any human helper.

This chapter shows how to give **simple, clear, step-by-step instructions** so Codex knows:

* **What you want**
* **What inputs it will get**
* **What output you expect**

---

## **Key Ideas Explained Step by Step**

### **1. Tell Codex exactly what you want it to build**

Imagine telling a carpenter:
“Make something nice.”
They will have no idea what you mean.

But if you say:
“Make a wooden table with 4 legs, 3 feet wide,”
the carpenter can start immediately.

Codex works the same way.

Good instruction examples:

* “Create a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns only the even numbers.”
* “Write an Autogen workflow where Agent A asks Agent B for a recipe.”

---

### **2. Mention the INPUTS clearly**

Codex needs to know:

* What data comes in?
* What format is it in?
* Is it a string? A number? A dictionary? A file?

Example:
“Input: a list of student dictionaries like
`[{ 'name': 'Riya', 'marks': 88 }, ... ]`”

This makes Codex’s job easy.

### **3. Mention the OUTPUT clearly**

Tell Codex exactly what you want back:

* A return value?
* A printed result?
* A JSON object?
* A completed Python script?

Example:
“Output: return a JSON dictionary with `avg_marks` and `total_students`.”

### **4. Keep steps simple and in order**

Codex loves **step-by-step checklists**.

Example:

1. Read the CSV file
2. Filter rows where price > 100
3. Save results to a new CSV
4. Print a success message

This avoids any confusion.

---

### **5. Give a small example if possible**

A tiny sample input/output helps Codex understand your intent perfectly.

Example:
Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
Output: `[2, 4]`

Think of it like teaching a child with examples.

## **Small, Practical Example**

### **Scenario: You want Codex to generate a function for calculating discounts**

**Your instruction to Codex should look like this:**

> **“Write a Python function `apply_discount(items)`
> Input: a list of dictionaries like `{ 'name': 'Shirt', 'price': 500 }`
> Rule: If price > 300, apply 10% discount
> Output: return a new list with updated prices
> Include a small example in the code comments.”**

Codex will now know exactly what to build.

## **Takeaway Summary**

* Codex thinks like a helpful junior developer.
* The clearer your request, the better the code it produces.
* Always specify:

  * **What to build**
  * **Inputs**
  * **Outputs**
  * **Steps**
  * **Example**

Clear instructions → Clear code.

## **Codex Instruction Prompt**

**“Generate a Python function that takes a list of items (`name`, `price`), applies a 10% discount to prices above 300, and returns the updated list. Include one input example and one output example in comments.”**
