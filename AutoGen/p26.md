# **Chapter 26 — Planning Agents**

### **Short Introduction**

When a task is big, it can feel like planning a full wedding alone — too many things to handle at once.
A **Planning Agent** works like the wedding coordinator. It doesn’t do all the work itself.
Instead, it **breaks a big job into small steps** and then assigns each step to the right helper agent.

This approach makes agentic systems smarter and more organized.

## **Key Ideas Explained Step by Step**

### **1. Why planning is needed**

Imagine a student preparing for exams:

* If they try to study the whole book at once → they feel lost.
* If they break it into chapters → easy, manageable, less stress.

Agentic AI works the same way.
A **Planner Agent** makes a big project feel simple.

### **2. How a Planning Agent behaves**

You can think of it like a **project manager**:

* Understands the user’s goal
* Breaks it into clear tasks
* Decides which agent should handle which part
* Collects results
* Combines everything into the final output

The planner itself stays calm and high-level.

### **3. Real-life analogy**

Running a restaurant:

* The **planner** = Head chef
* The **helpers** = cooks for salad, grill, dessert, drinks
* The head chef says:

  * “You prepare starter.”
  * “You grill chicken.”
  * “You handle desserts.”
* Each cook works on their part.
* The head chef assembles the entire meal.

Similarly, the Planning Agent coordinates all AI agents.

### **4. How it works in Autogen**

You may have:

* **PlannerAgent**
* **WriterAgent**
* **ResearchAgent**
* **ProofreaderAgent**
* **CoderAgent**

Example flow:

1. User: “Create a full travel guide for Singapore.”
2. PlannerAgent:

   * Step 1: Research places → send to ResearchAgent
   * Step 2: Write introduction → send to WriterAgent
   * Step 3: Check clarity → send to ProofreaderAgent
3. PlannerAgent collects all parts
4. PlannerAgent returns final result to user

### **5. Small Practical Example (simple scenario)**

**User goal:**
“Help me launch a small online bakery.”

**Planner Agent breaks into tasks:**

* Task 1: Market research → send to ResearchAgent
* Task 2: Menu ideas → send to IdeasAgent
* Task 3: Website content → send to WriterAgent
* Task 4: Social media plan → send to MarketingAgent

Each helper agent produces its piece.
PlannerAgent merges everything into one simple plan.

## **Takeaway Summary**

* Planning Agents are like project managers.
* They break large goals into small, easy tasks.
* They choose which agent should do each task.
* They collect the results and produce a final answer.
* This approach keeps everything more organized and reliable.

## **Codex Instruction Task**

**“Create a PlannerAgent in Autogen that takes a big user request, breaks it into smaller tasks, and assigns each task to helper agents like WriterAgent or ResearchAgent. Add helpful comments so beginners understand how the planner decides and routes work.”**
