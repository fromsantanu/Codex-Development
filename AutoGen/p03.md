# **Chapter 3 — Installing Autogen (Step by Step)**

### **Short Introduction**

Before we build AI agents, we need to set up our computer.
Think of this like preparing a small office: installing Python, creating a workspace, and giving the agents a key (your OpenAI API key) so they can think and talk.

---

# **Key Ideas (Step by Step)**

### **1. Install Python**

Autogen works with Python.
If Python is not installed, download it from the official website.
Any recent version (3.10, 3.11, 3.12) works well.

### **2. Create a Virtual Environment**

A virtual environment is like giving your agents their **own clean room**.
This keeps your packages organised.

Open your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python -m venv autogen-env
```

Activate it:

**Windows**

```bash
autogen-env\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux**

```bash
source autogen-env/bin/activate
```

---

### **3. Install Autogen**

Now install Autogen using pip:

```bash
pip install pyautogen
```

This downloads everything needed to run talking agents.

---

### **4. Set Your OpenAI API Key**

The API key is like a **door key** that lets the agent think.

Create an environment variable:

**Windows**

```bash
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_key_here"
```

**Mac/Linux**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

Replace `"your_key_here"` with your real key.

### **5. First Test Script — “Hello Agent”**

Create a file called `hello_agent.py` with this simple example:

```python
import autogen

# Create a simple agent
assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="helper",
    llm_config={"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
)

# Make the agent talk
response = assistant.run("Say hello in a friendly way.")
print(response)
```

Run it:

```bash
python hello_agent.py
```

If everything is correct, the agent will greet you.

# **Takeaway Summary**

* Install Python
* Create a virtual environment
* Install Autogen with pip
* Add your OpenAI API key
* Run a simple “Hello Agent” script

With this setup, you are ready to build your first agent team.
