# Chapter 6. Single Assistant Agent

**One AI answering questions (like a homework helper)**

---

#### 1. What is a “single assistant agent”?

Think of a **single assistant agent** as **one very smart helper** sitting at a desk.

* You ask it a question.
* It thinks.
* It gives you an answer.

That’s it.
No team, no multiple agents talking.
Just **one AI**, focused on **helping you directly**.

In Autogen, this is usually called something like an `AssistantAgent`.

#### 2. Real-life picture: School homework helper

Imagine a student in school:

* They have math, science, history homework.
* Sometimes they get stuck.
* Instead of calling five teachers, they talk to **one friendly tutor**.

That tutor:

* Listens to their question
* Explains step by step
* Gives simple examples
* Corrects them if needed

A **single assistant agent in Autogen** can play this tutor role:

* Student: “I don’t understand fractions.”
* Agent: “Okay, think of a pizza cut into 8 slices…”
* Student: “How do I add 1/4 and 1/2?”
* Agent: “Let’s draw it mentally and add the slices…”

So you can think of this agent as a **personal AI teacher**.

#### 3. How Autogen fits here

Autogen is like the **framework** that helps you:

* Create this AI “tutor”
* Give it a name and settings
* Ask it questions in Python
* Get back answers as text

You don’t have to build the “brain” of the AI.
Autogen lets you **connect** to a powerful model (like an OpenAI model) and wrap it as an **assistant**.

Simple idea:

1. In Python, you **create** an assistant agent.
2. You **send** a question to it.
3. You **print** the answer.

#### 4. A tiny Autogen example (conceptual)

Don’t worry if you don’t know Python well.
Just read this like a story of what the code is doing.

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent

# 1. Create one assistant agent (our homework helper)
assistant = AssistantAgent(
    name="homework_helper",
    llm_config={
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",      # which AI model to use
        "temperature": 0.3           # how creative it should be
    }
)

# 2. Ask a question (like a student)
user_message = {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Explain photosynthesis in very simple words."
}

# 3. Let the assistant think and reply
reply = assistant.generate_reply(messages=[user_message])

# 4. Show the answer
print(reply)
```

In plain language:

* We **create** an AI called `"homework_helper"`.
* We **send** it a question: “Explain photosynthesis…”
* We **get** an answer and **print** it.

You can later change the question:

* “Help me solve 2x + 3 = 11”
* “Explain World War II in 5 simple points.”
* “Give me 3 practice questions on fractions.”

Same agent, different questions.

#### 5. Why start with a single agent?

Before building **complex teams of agents**, it is good to:

* Start with **one agent**
* Learn how to **ask questions**
* Learn how to **read and use answers**
* Add simple logic around it (e.g., log the questions, save answers, etc.)

Once you are comfortable with a single assistant agent, it becomes easier to:

* Add a second agent (e.g., “checker” or “critic”)
* Add tools (e.g., calculator, database, web search)
* Build more realistic workflows.

---

#### 6. Takeaway

* A **single assistant agent** is like **one smart AI tutor**.
* It is perfect for things like a **school homework helper**.
* Autogen lets you create this agent in Python and talk to it.
* This is the **basic building block** for larger agentic AI systems.

### Codex task for this chapter

**Instruction for Codex:**

> “Write a Python script that creates a simple Autogen assistant. The assistant should answer homework-style questions (math or science) in very simple language. Add comments explaining each step so a beginner can understand.”
