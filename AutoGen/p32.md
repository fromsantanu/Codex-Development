# **Chapter 32. How to Debug Using Codex**

*Let Codex act like a friendly senior developer*

---

### **Short Introduction**

Bugs are normal.
Error messages (tracebacks) are like “complaint letters” from your program.

Instead of getting scared, you can **show the error to Codex** and ask:

* “What does this mean?”
* “How do I fix it?”

In this chapter, we learn how to use Codex as a **debugging helper**.

---

## **Key Ideas Explained Step by Step**

### **1. What is a traceback? (In simple words)**

A **traceback** is the long error message you see when Python crashes.

It usually contains:

* The file name
* The line number
* The code line where it failed
* The error type, like `TypeError`, `KeyError`, `ValueError`, etc.

Think of it like a **doctor’s report**:

* Where is the pain? → line number
* Which part is affected? → function / variable
* What kind of problem? → error type

You will give this “report” to Codex.

---

### **2. Copy the full traceback, not just the last line**

Many people only copy the last line:

```text
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

This is useful, but not enough.

Codex understands better if you give the **full traceback**, for example:

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 15, in <module>
    total = a + b
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

This tells Codex:

* Which file (`main.py`)
* Which line (`line 15`)
* What code (`total = a + b`)

So always **copy-paste the whole error block**.

---

### **3. Show Codex the code + the traceback together**

Codex needs to see **both**:

1. The part of the code that caused the error
2. The traceback message

Example of a good request to Codex:

> “Here is my Python code snippet and the error I get.
> Please explain the cause and show me how to fix it.”
>
> ```python
> a = 10
> b = "20"
> total = a + b
> print(total)
> ```
>
> Error:
>
> ```text
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "main.py", line 3, in <module>
>     total = a + b
> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
> ```

Now Codex can:

* Explain the error in simple language
* Suggest how to fix it

---

### **4. Ask Codex for explanation in simple words**

Don’t just say “fix this.”

Ask Codex to **teach you**, like a tutor.

For example:

> “Explain this error in simple language, like I am a beginner.
> Why is it happening and what should I change?”

Codex might answer:

* You are trying to add a number (`int`) and text (`str`).
* Convert `"20"` to an integer: `int("20")`
* Or convert `10` to a string: `str(10)`

This way, you **learn the concept**, not only the fix.

---

### **5. Ask Codex for a corrected version of the code**

After explanation, ask:

> “Now show me the corrected version of the code.”

Codex might give you:

```python
a = 10
b = "20"

# Option 1: both as integers
total = a + int(b)
print(total)  # 30

# Option 2: both as strings
total_str = str(a) + b
print(total_str)  # "1020"
```

You can then choose which is correct for your situation.

---

### **6. When the bug is bigger (multi-file projects)**

For larger programs:

* Show Codex:

  * The traceback
  * The main function or main script
  * Any related function where the error points

Ask like this:

> “Here is the traceback and the code around that line.
> Please trace the flow and tell me where the bug is and suggest a fix.”

Codex can often follow the flow and point to:

* Wrong variable name
* Missing return
* Wrong data type
* Wrong import

## **Small, Practical Example**

### **Scenario: A student gets a `KeyError` when accessing a dictionary**

**Your request to Codex:**

> “I am getting a KeyError in this code.
> Please explain why in simple language and then fix the code.”
>
> ```python
> student = {
>     "name": "Riya",
>     "marks": 88
> }
>
> print(student["score"])
> ```
>
> Error:
>
> ```text
> Traceback (most recent call last):
>   File "student.py", line 6, in <module>
>     print(student["score"])
> KeyError: 'score'
> ```

Codex will likely:

* Explain that the dictionary has key `"marks"`, not `"score"`.
* Suggest using `student["marks"]` or adding `"score"` to the dictionary.

It might also show:

```python
print(student["marks"])
# or
print(student.get("score", "No score found"))
```

You not only fix this bug, but also learn about keys and `dict.get()`.

## **Takeaway Summary**

* A **traceback** is just the program telling you what went wrong and where.
* Codex is very good at reading tracebacks + code.
* Always give Codex:

  * The full error message
  * The related code
* Ask for:

  * A simple explanation
  * A clear, corrected version of the code

Use Codex like a **patient senior developer** who explains and fixes bugs.

## **Codex Instruction Prompt**

**“I will paste a Python traceback and the related code. Explain the error in very simple language, then show a corrected version of the code with comments. Here is the code and error:”**

(Then you paste your code + full traceback below this prompt.)
