# **Chapter 1 — What is Agentic AI?**

### **Short Introduction**

Think of agentic AI as a small team of smart workers inside a computer.
Each worker can think, decide, and take action. They don’t just *answer questions* like a normal chatbot — they **do tasks** step by step, just like people working together in an office.

# **Key Ideas (Step by Step)**

### **1. Normal Chatbots = One Person at a Help Desk**

A normal chatbot is like a single person sitting at a help desk.
You ask something → they reply with an answer.
That’s all.

They do **not** plan work, talk to other workers, or take actions on their own.

Example:
You ask, “What groceries should I buy?”
The chatbot gives a list — but it will not actually go and order them.

### **2. Agentic AI = A Team That Thinks and Takes Action**

Agentic AI works like a **team of workers in a company**.

* One worker understands the problem
* Another searches for information
* Another compares options
* Another takes action (place order, send email, write code, etc.)

All of them can **talk to each other**, plan, and execute tasks automatically.

This teamwork is why we call them *agents*.

### **3. Real-Life Comparison**

Imagine you tell your assistant at home:

> “Please buy groceries for the week.”

A normal chatbot would only give suggestions.

An **agentic AI** would:

1. Make a list based on your past choices
2. Compare prices on different websites
3. Apply discounts or coupons
4. Place the order
5. Send you a confirmation
6. Remind you next week if you want to repeat the order

It behaves like a **thinking helper**, not just a talking chatbot.

# **A Simple Example: AI Buying Groceries Online**

Let’s imagine a small agentic system with three agents:

### **Agent 1: Planner**

Like a team leader.
It breaks the big goal (“buy groceries”) into small steps.

### **Agent 2: Researcher**

Finds items, compares websites, checks prices.

### **Agent 3: Action Agent**

Places the order on the website using APIs.

**Flow in simple words:**

* You say: “Get groceries for ₹1500 with fruits and vegetables.”
* Planner says: “Okay team, let’s figure this out.”
* Researcher searches online, checks prices, and makes a list.
* Planner reviews it and approves.
* Action Agent goes online and completes the purchase.
* You get a message: “Order placed!”

This is agentic AI — **goal → plan → action**, just like people working together.

# **Takeaway Summary**

* Normal chatbots **only talk**.
* Agentic AI systems **think, plan, and act** like a small team of workers.
* They can break big tasks into steps and complete them automatically.
* Real-life use: buying groceries, booking travel, analysing data, writing code, etc.

# **How to Use Codex (Prompt for Students)**

**Codex Instruction Prompt:**
“Explain agentic AI with simple examples that college students can relate to, such as buying groceries or planning a trip. Keep the explanation friendly and easy to understand.”
