# **Chapter 25 — Self-Critic Agent Pattern**

### **Short Introduction**

Sometimes you need an AI that doesn’t just write something…
…it also checks its own work, like a student writing an essay and then asking a friend to point out mistakes.

The **Self-Critic Agent Pattern** works exactly like that.

You use **two agents**:

1. **Drafting Agent** — writes the first version
2. **Critic Agent** — reviews, points out issues, and suggests improvements

Then the drafting agent writes again using the critic’s feedback.

This loop makes the output much clearer and more reliable.

## **Key Ideas Explained Step by Step**

### **1. Think of it like cooking and tasting**

Imagine you are making a dish.

* **Cook = drafting agent** → prepares the food
* **Taster = critic agent** → tastes and says, “Little more salt… too spicy… add lemon…”

The cook then tries again and improves the dish.

AI behaves the same way.

### **2. Why this pattern is useful**

* It reduces mistakes
* It improves clarity
* It gives more polished results
* It catches missing details automatically
* It feels like an internal review system

### **3. How it works in Autogen**

You create **two agents** with different personalities:

* **WriterAgent** → friendly, creative, explains things
* **CriticAgent** → strict, analytical, finds weaknesses

Then you let them talk to each other in a loop:

1. Writer creates version 1
2. Critic points out issues
3. Writer rewrites a better version
4. Critic approves or gives new comments

### **4. Small Practical Example (everyday scenario)**

**Scenario:**
An AI writes a small product description for a shop.

* WriterAgent writes:
  “This bottle is very good and useful.”

* CriticAgent replies:
  “Too vague. Add details like capacity, usage, and benefits. Keep the tone simple.”

* WriterAgent improves:
  “This is a 1-litre leak-proof water bottle. It keeps drinks cold for 8 hours and is easy to carry.”

* CriticAgent approves:
  “Much better. Clear and helpful.”

This is the heart of the self-critic loop.

## **Takeaway Summary**

* Use **two agents**: one writes, one reviews.
* They talk to each other like two colleagues refining a document.
* This pattern gives cleaner, higher-quality results.
* Works great for writing: reports, code, policies, emails, summaries, etc.
* Think of it like **cook → taster → cook again**.

## **Codex Instruction Task**

**“Generate a drafting + critic + improvement workflow using Autogen.
Create two agents: WriterAgent writes a draft, CriticAgent reviews it, and WriterAgent rewrites based on the feedback.
Add simple comments so a beginner can understand how the loop works.”**
