# **Chapter 30 — When NOT to Use Agentic Systems**

### **Short Introduction**

Agentic systems are powerful, like hiring a whole team to help you.
But you don’t call a full construction crew just to fix a loose screw.
In the same way, many tasks are simple enough for **one normal AI model** — no need for multiple agents.

This chapter teaches you how to recognise when Autogen (multi-agent workflows) is *not* the right choice.

## **Key Ideas Explained Step by Step**

### **1. Simple questions don’t need agents**

If the task is short and can be done in one reply, agents add unnecessary complexity.

Examples:

* “What is the capital of Japan?”
* “Explain Python lists in 3 sentences.”
* “Summarise this paragraph.”

This is like asking three teachers to answer a question that one teacher can handle easily.

### **2. Tasks that do NOT need planning or teamwork**

If the problem has:

* No steps
* No back-and-forth reasoning
* No external tools
* No code execution
* No long context

…then one simple AI call is enough.

Think of it like a small grocery list — you don’t create departments or workflows for it.

### **3. When agents actually slow things down**

Agentic systems bring overhead:

* More messages
* More tokens
* More cost
* More time
* More chances of confusion

For short answers, a single model is faster, cheaper, and cleaner.

### **4. When data is small**

If the input is tiny:

* A short text
* A simple instruction
* One file
* One small piece of code

Then multi-agent collaboration won’t add value.

Use agents only when the task is big enough to justify teamwork.

### **5. Everyday real-life analogy**

Imagine:

* **Single task:** Heating one cup of tea — you do it yourself.
* **Complex task:** Preparing a wedding dinner — you need a team.

AI behaves the same way.

### **6. Good examples where Autogen is NOT required**

* Simple translation
* One-line code fixes
* Basic fact lookup
* Quick definitions
* Simple school explanations
* Writing short notes
* Creating a single SQL query
* Fixing one bug in a small script
* Rewriting a small paragraph
* Generating 3–4 ideas

In all these, one LLM is enough.

### **7. When Autogen DOES make sense (contrast)**

Use agents only when:

* Task has multiple steps
* Needs research + writing + checking
* Includes code execution
* Large data or complex decisions
* Multiple roles needed (writer, critic, planner, coder)
* Requires memory or tool calling

This helps you judge correctly.

## **Takeaway Summary**

* Not every job needs a team — simple tasks are better handled by a single AI model.
* If the task is short, clear, or requires only one answer, avoid agents.
* Agents add extra cost and time when unnecessary.
* Use Autogen only for multi-step, tool-heavy, or complex reasoning workflows.

## **Codex Instruction Task**

**“Write a simple checklist that helps decide whether Autogen is needed.
Include questions like:
• Is the task multi-step?
• Do we need multiple roles?
• Are tools/databases involved?
• Is memory required?
• Is a single answer enough?
Output the checklist in plain, beginner-friendly language.”**
