# **Chapter 33. How to Generate Project Structure**

*Let Codex set up folders, comments, and tests for you*

---

### **Short Introduction**

When you start a new software project, the first problem is often:

> “Where do I put what?”

Like building a house, you need:

* Rooms for different activities (folders/directories)
* Labels on doors (docstrings and comments)
* Regular checks to see if things are working (tests)

Codex can help you **create this whole project skeleton** so you don’t start from a blank screen every time.

---

## **Key Ideas Explained Step by Step**

### **1. Directories = rooms in your project house**

Imagine a small clinic building:

* Reception room
* Doctor’s room
* Pharmacy room
* Records room

Each room has its own purpose.

In a Python / Autogen project, directories are like rooms:

* `app/` → main code
* `app/agents/` → agent definitions
* `app/tools/` → helper functions
* `tests/` → test files
* `docs/` → documentation or notes

You can ask Codex:

> “Generate a basic folder structure for an Autogen project with agents, tools, and tests.”

Codex can output:

```text
my_autogen_project/
  app/
    __init__.py
    main.py
    agents/
      __init__.py
      travel_agent.py
      booking_agent.py
    tools/
      __init__.py
      flight_api.py
      hotel_api.py
  tests/
    test_agents.py
    test_tools.py
  docs/
    README.md
  requirements.txt
```

You don’t have to type this by hand.

### **2. Docstrings = labels & instructions inside each room**

Inside each room, you may keep a note:

* “This cupboard stores patient files.”
* “This drawer has prescription pads.”

In code, **docstrings** are small text blocks at the top of functions/classes that explain:

* What this function does
* What inputs it takes
* What it returns

Example:

```python
def calculate_discount(price: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate a 10% discount on the given price.

    Args:
        price: Original price as a float.

    Returns:
        Discounted price as a float.
    """
    return price * 0.9
```

You can ask Codex:

> “For each function, add a clear docstring in simple English explaining what it does, its inputs, and outputs.”

Codex will then:

* Insert proper docstrings
* Make your code self-explanatory
* Help future you and your students understand quickly

### **3. Tests = regular health check-ups for your project**

A clinic needs regular checks:

* Is the equipment working?
* Are medicines not expired?

Similarly, your project needs **tests** to check:

* Does the function give correct output?
* Does it fail properly for wrong input?

In Python, tests usually go in a `tests/` folder and use a framework like `pytest`.

Example of a simple test file:

```python
# tests/test_discount.py

from app.pricing import calculate_discount

def test_calculate_discount():
    original = 100.0
    discounted = calculate_discount(original)
    assert discounted == 90.0
```

You can ask Codex:

> “Generate pytest test files for my main functions and put them inside a tests/ directory. Each test should be simple and easy to read.”

Codex can:

* Create test files
* Write basic tests
* Help you start with good habits

---

### **4. Putting it all together with Codex**

A good pattern for using Codex:

1. **Describe the project** in one or two lines

   * “This is a small Autogen project with travel and hotel agents.”

2. **Ask for folder structure**

   * “Generate a clean folder structure with app/, app/agents/, app/tools/, tests/, and docs/.”

3. **Ask for starter files**

   * `main.py` that runs a simple agent conversation
   * Empty agent files with docstrings
   * Test files with one simple test each

4. **Ask for docstrings and tests**

   * “Add docstrings to each function and generate one pytest test per important function.”

Codex becomes your **project architect + assistant coder**.

## **Small, Practical Example**

### **Scenario: You want a starter Autogen project for a “Laptop Advisor” agent**

**Your request to Codex could be:**

> “Create a basic Python project structure for an Autogen-based ‘Laptop Advisor’ app.
>
> Requirements:
>
> * Root folder: `laptop_advisor/`
> * Inside it: `app/`, `app/agents/`, `app/tools/`, `tests/`, and `docs/`
> * Create `app/main.py` that runs a simple conversation with one advisor agent.
> * Add clear docstrings to all functions in simple English.
> * Create a `tests/test_main.py` file with one basic test that checks a helper function.
>   Show the folder tree and the contents of each main file.”

Codex can then respond with:

* Folder tree
* Sample `main.py`
* A simple agent definition
* A test file
* Docstrings included

You get a **ready-made skeleton** to start coding.

## **Takeaway Summary**

* A good project structure makes life easy for you and your students.
* **Directories** keep related code together.
* **Docstrings** explain what each part does.
* **Tests** keep the project healthy over time.
* Codex can **generate all three**: folders, docstrings, and test files—if you describe them clearly.

Build once with Codex → reuse structure for many projects.

## **Codex Instruction Prompt**

**“Generate a clean Python project structure for an Autogen-based app called ‘ClinicHelper’.
Include:

* `app/` with `main.py`, `agents/`, and `tools/`
* `tests/` with at least one pytest file
* `docs/` with a basic README.md
  Add clear docstrings to all functions in simple English and create one simple test per important function. Show the folder tree and file contents.”**
