# Chapter 20. AI Research Writer

*(Collect Sources → Summarize → Write Clear Article)*

When you work on any research topic, you usually do three things:

1. **Collect sources**
   – Find papers, news, blogs, datasets, etc.
2. **Understand them**
   – Read, highlight, summarize
3. **Write something meaningful**
   – Literature review, background section, short article

An **AI Research Writer** can behave like two helpers working together:

* One agent who **collects and studies sources**
* Another agent who **writes a clean, structured article** based on those summaries

This chapter shows how this two-agent system works.

---

## 1. The main idea

Think of this as a mini research team:

1. **Research Collector Agent**

   * Finds links, extracts key points
   * Creates bullet summaries
   * Points out similarities and differences between sources

2. **Research Writer Agent**

   * Takes summaries
   * Turns them into a readable article
   * Organizes into Introduction → Key Ideas → Comparisons → Gaps → Conclusion

Both agents work in a loop:

* Collector → sends summaries
* Writer → drafts article
* Collector → checks missing points
* Writer → improves draft

This feels like two graduate students helping each other.

## 2. Roles of the two agents

### 2.1 Research Collector Agent

*(Finds, reads, summarizes)*

This agent does:

* Reads the prompt (“Literature review on diabetes prediction models”).
* Collects 3–5 key sources (titles, abstracts, key ideas).
* Extracts:

  * main goals
  * methods
  * datasets
  * results
  * limitations
* Writes a **short structured summary** of each source.

Real-life analogy:
Someone who goes to the library, takes notes, and hands them to the writer.

### 2.2 Research Writer Agent

*(Uses summaries → Produces clean article)*

This agent:

* Takes summaries from the collector
* Writes:

  * **Introduction** – background
  * **What each source found**
  * **Comparison** – what is common, what is different
  * **Research gaps** – where future work is needed
  * **Conclusion** – what we learn overall

Real-life analogy:
A writer who looks at notes and drafts a simple, clear literature review.

## 3. Simple workflow: step by step

Imagine the topic:

> “Write a short literature review on early detection of heart disease using machine learning.”

Here is how the two agents work:

### Step 1 — User gives topic

User: “Create a literature review on heart disease ML models.”

### Step 2 — Research Collector Agent

* Finds 3–4 relevant sources.
* Extracts methods (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Nets).
* Summarizes dataset details and accuracy ranges.
* Produces a structured set of notes.

### Step 3 — Sends notes to Research Writer Agent

Collector → Writer:
“Here are 4 papers, with key methods and results.”

### Step 4 — Research Writer Agent

* Builds a clean article:

  * Intro
  * Paper 1 summary
  * Paper 2 summary
  * Comparison
  * Gaps
  * Conclusion

### Step 5 — Optional loop

Writer asks Collector:

* “Any paper on deep learning architectures?”
  Collector returns with more notes.
  Writer updates the final version.

This forms a neat **literature review pipeline**.

## 4. Simple Autogen code: Two talking agents for literature review

Below is a small, beginner-friendly sketch.

```python
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent, GroupChat, GroupChatManager

# 1. Collector agent – finds and summarizes sources
collector = AssistantAgent(
    name="collector_agent",
    system_message=(
        "You are a research collector. "
        "Your job: find 3–5 relevant sources for the user's topic, "
        "extract key points (goal, methods, dataset, findings, limitations) "
        "and send structured summaries. "
        "Keep your language simple. "
        "Do NOT write the final article."
    ),
)

# 2. Writer agent – creates clean literature review
writer = AssistantAgent(
    name="writer_agent",
    system_message=(
        "You are a research writer. "
        "Take the collector's summaries and turn them into a clear literature review "
        "with: Introduction, Key Papers, Comparison, Gaps, and Conclusion. "
        "Use easy language so beginners can understand. "
        "Do NOT invent findings; only use collector summaries."
    ),
)

# 3. User agent
user = UserProxyAgent(
    name="user",
    human_input_mode="ALWAYS",
)

# 4. Group chat where collector and writer talk
group_chat = GroupChat(
    agents=[user, collector, writer],
    messages=[],
    max_round=10,
)

manager = GroupChatManager(
    groupchat=group_chat,
    name="manager"
)

# 5. Start the pipeline
user.initiate_chat(
    manager,
    message="Please create a literature review on early detection of heart disease using machine learning."
)
```

### What this code does (in simple words)

* You give a research topic.
* Collector agent gathers sources and creates summaries.
* Writer agent turns those summaries into a readable literature review.
* Both agents talk inside one group chat.
* You receive a well-written final article.

This is a clean example of **multi-agent research writing**.

## 5. How this helps in real life

An AI Research Writer can:

* Speed up academic tasks
* Help students write background chapters
* Provide first drafts for health, AI, business, and social science topics
* Assist in reviewing multiple papers quickly
* Keep writing structure consistent and clean

For teachers, this is an excellent demo of:

* Multi-agent collaboration
* Summarization + analysis + writing
* Controlled information handover

---

## 6. Takeaway

* Use two agents:

  * **Collector Agent** finds sources and notes
  * **Writer Agent** turns them into structured literature review
* This pipeline is simple but powerful for academic writing.
* You can add more agents later: citation agent, fact-check agent, PDF reader agent, etc.

## Codex Instruction Prompt for This Chapter

Give Codex this instruction:

> **“Generate a two-agent Autogen pipeline where the first agent collects and summarizes research sources for a topic, and the second agent writes a literature review using those summaries. Include comments so beginners can follow easily.”**
