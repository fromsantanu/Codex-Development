# **Chapter 4 — Autogen Architecture (A Simple Story)**

### **Short Introduction**

Autogen works like a small office where messages move from one desk to another.
You give a task → one agent understands it → another agent helps → and finally they use tools or a database to finish the job.

Let’s understand this with a small travel story.

# **Key Ideas (Step by Step)**

### **1. Basic Flow in Autogen**

Autogen systems usually follow this simple path:

**User → Agent A → Agent B → Tools / Database**

You can imagine this like three desks in a row.
Your request moves from one desk to the next until the work is done.

### **2. Story of Two Agents Working Together**

Imagine you want to plan a short trip.

You ask:

> “Please find a good hotel for my Pune weekend trip.”

Now see how the two agents handle this.

---

### **3. Agent A = Travel Agent**

This agent behaves like a friendly travel planner.

It breaks your request into small steps:

* Check your dates
* Check your budget
* Ask another agent to search hotels
* Combine everything and prepare the final plan

Agent A is like the **team leader** who understands your problem.

### **4. Agent B = Hotel Agent**

Agent B is the helper who knows hotel details.
It can search websites, compare options, and read reviews.

Agent B might say:

* “Here are 3 hotels with prices.”
* “This one fits your budget.”
* “I will check availability using the hotel API.”

Agent B does the **ground work**.

### **5. Tools and Database Layer**

After the agents discuss:

* They may call a **hotel booking API**
* They may check a **database of past bookings**
* They may use a **calculator or script** to compare prices

This is where real action happens.

### **6. Final Response**

After the teamwork:

* Agent A prepares a final, clean answer
* You receive a simple travel plan

This is how Autogen structures multi-agent work.

# **Takeaway Summary**

* Autogen uses a “chain of agents” system
* User gives a task → Agent A plans → Agent B searches → Tools finish the job
* It works like a travel agent and hotel agent discussing and completing your request
* This structure makes Autogen perfect for complex, step-by-step tasks
