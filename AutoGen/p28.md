# **Chapter 28 — Multi-Step Goal Completion**

### **Short Introduction**

Some goals cannot be finished in one step.
They are like preparing for a job interview — you don’t just wake up and walk in.
You practice, research the company, prepare questions, and do mock interviews.

A **Multi-Step Agent** follows this same idea.
It completes a big goal by moving through **a sequence of smaller steps**, one after another, in the correct order.

## **Key Ideas Explained Step by Step**

### **1. Why multi-step thinking matters**

Think of getting ready for a wedding invitation:

1. Choose clothes
2. Iron them
3. Book a cab
4. Carry the gift
5. Leave at the right time

If you mix the order, everything becomes a mess.

Similarly, an agent must:

* Understand the **goal**
* Break it into **ordered steps**
* Work through each step
* Produce the final result

This turns the agent into a mini “workflow engine.”

### **2. How multi-step goals work in Autogen**

Autogen makes this easy:

1. You give the agent a goal
2. It decides the steps
3. It performs Step 1
4. Once done → moves to Step 2
5. Continues until the final result is ready

You can also create helper agents for individual tasks.

### **3. Everyday analogy**

Preparing for a job interview:

* Step 1: Research the company
* Step 2: Study the job role
* Step 3: Prepare answers to common questions
* Step 4: Create a 1-minute self-introduction
* Step 5: Do a mock interview
* Step 6: Review mistakes and improve

A multi-step agent can do this automatically.

### **4. Practical Example: AI job interview preparation**

Let’s imagine a student asks:

“Help me prepare for a Data Analyst interview.”

The agent may break it like this:

* Step 1: Research the company
* Step 2: Make a list of required skills
* Step 3: Prepare answers for common questions
* Step 4: Generate a mock interview
* Step 5: Give feedback for improvement

At the end, the student gets a full preparation kit.

### **5. Why this pattern is useful**

* Keeps the workflow organised
* Avoids jumping between tasks
* Produces complete results
* Easy to debug and expand
* Works great for any big task:

  * writing reports
  * planning trips
  * building apps
  * creating study plans
  * preparing resumes
  * analysing datasets

## **Takeaway Summary**

* Multi-step completion = finishing a big goal one small step at a time.
* It works like following a to-do list in the correct order.
* Agents become more reliable and predictable.
* Perfect for long, thoughtful tasks like interview prep, trip planning, or project design.

## **Codex Instruction Task**

**“Write Autogen code where an agent completes a goal using a sequence of steps.
The agent should:

1. define steps,
2. execute each step one by one,
3. store the result of each step, and
4. return a final combined output.
   Add comments so beginners understand how the workflow moves from one step to the next.”**
