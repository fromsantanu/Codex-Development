# Chapter 1. React basics for backend folks

## Introduction

We start with a simple idea: the frontend is the friendly desk where customers look at their data. In this chapter we learn how React lets us build that desk using pieces called components. Our example is a customer list for a sales team that pulls fresh data from a backend customer API.

## Key Concepts

- **JSX looks like HTML but lives in JavaScript.** Think of it as writing your layout right where you write logic, like adding a note next to your SQL query.
- **Components are small UI parts.** Each component is like a small window in a dashboard—easy to build and reuse.
- **React renders components into a single page.** The whole UI is just a tree of components, similar to how an ORM organizes related models in a hierarchy.

## Step-by-step Implementation

1. **Create a simple component.**

   ```jsx
   function CustomerDesk() {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Customers Awaiting Follow-up</h1>
         <p>Information will show here soon.</p>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Render it in the main app file.**

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import CustomerDesk from './CustomerDesk';

   ReactDOM.render(<CustomerDesk />, document.getElementById('root'));
   ```

3. **Think of components as functions.** Just like you write a Python function that returns a query result, a React component returns JSX describing the HTML.

4. **Add props and simple data (preview for next chapter).** You can pass text like function arguments into the component for flexibility.

## How to Use Codex Here

1. “Generate a React component called `WelcomeCard` that shows a header and a note for the customer team.”
2. “Explain how ReactDOM renders a component into `#root` and show a minimal example.”
3. “Create a small JSX snippet that would include a title and paragraph for a customer follow-up list.”
4. “Add a comment that reminds me where to mount the component in `index.html`.”

## Mini-Exercise

Add a second component called `IntroNote` that shows the current date and a brief reminder to check customer accounts today.
