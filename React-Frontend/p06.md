# Chapter 6. Simple routing and navigation

## Introduction

Customers want to move between a list view and a detail page. Routing lets React swap components without refreshing the browser. We'll add navigation so the team can go from the customer list to detail views and a quick dashboard.

## Key Concepts

- **Routes match URLs to components.** Think of it as a receptionist routing calls based on customer choice.
- **Links change the URL without reloading the page.** Like a tab on a CRM that switches sections instantly.
- **Route parameters pass IDs.** When the user visits `/customers/5`, React knows to load the record with ID 5.

## Step-by-step Implementation

1. **Install and import React Router.**

   ```jsx
   import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   ```

2. **Wrap the app in `<BrowserRouter>`.**

   ```jsx
   function App() {
     return (
       <BrowserRouter>
         <nav>
           <Link to="/customers">Customers</Link>
           <Link to="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>
         </nav>
         <Routes>
           <Route path="/customers" element={<CustomerList />} />
           <Route path="/customers/:id" element={<CustomerDetail />} />
           <Route path="/dashboard" element={<SalesDashboard />} />
         </Routes>
       </BrowserRouter>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Use a route parameter to fetch a customer by ID.**

   ```jsx
   import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

   function CustomerDetail() {
     const { id } = useParams();
     // fetch `/api/customers/${id}` inside useEffect
     return <div>Customer detail for {id}</div>;
   }
   ```

4. **Example navigation scenario.** The salesperson clicks “Customers”, sees a list, then clicks a name which takes them to `/customers/4` so the detail component can load more info about customer 4.

## How to Use Codex Here

1. “Create an `App` component that sets up routes for `/customers` and `/customers/:id` and includes navigation links.”
2. “Show how to grab the `id` route parameter using `useParams` and call `/api/customers/{id}` inside `useEffect`.”
3. “Add a default `Route` with `path="*"` that shows a friendly 404 message.”
4. “Explain how React Router keeps the page from refreshing when a `<Link>` is clicked.”

## Mini-Exercise

Add a sidebar link for “Clinic schedule” that routes to `/schedule` and renders a placeholder component describing upcoming appointments.
