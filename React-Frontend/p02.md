# Chapter 2. Components, props, and state

## Introduction

Now that you see a basic React view, we dive deeper with components that accept props (inputs) and remember their own state. Imagine a shop counter where the cashier writes down what a customer picks—props are the customer's request, state is what the cashier remembers after several steps.

## Key Concepts

- **Props are inputs from parents.** A parent component gives data like a manager handing over customer info to a cashier.
- **State lives inside a component.** Use `useState` to keep track of what the user typed, similar to a scratch pad during a call with a client.
- **State changes re-render.** When the scratch pad updates, the component redraws itself with fresh info, just like updating a dashboard table.

## Step-by-step Implementation

1. **Create a customer card component that accepts props.**

   ```jsx
   function CustomerCard({ name, status }) {
     return (
       <div className="card">
         <h2>{name}</h2>
         <p>Status: {status}</p>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Use the card in a list with hardcoded props.**

   ```jsx
   function CustomerList() {
     return (
       <div>
         <CustomerCard name="Nina Patel" status="Awaiting demo" />
         <CustomerCard name="Marco Ruiz" status="Signed contract" />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Add state with `useState`.** This lets the component remember which customer is selected.

   ```jsx
   import { useState } from 'react';

   function CustomerSelector() {
     const [selected, setSelected] = useState('Nina Patel');

     return (
       <div>
         <p>Selected customer: {selected}</p>
         <button onClick={() => setSelected('Marco Ruiz')}>Choose Marco</button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

4. **Combine props and state.** Pass the selected name down as a prop to `CustomerCard` so the UI stays in sync.

## How to Use Codex Here

1. “Create a React component called `CustomerCard` that shows name, email, and a status badge passed as props.”
2. “Show how to import and use `useState` to remember which customer is active, and toggle it with a button.”
3. “Refactor the list example to map over an array of customer objects instead of repeating `<CustomerCard>` manually.”
4. “Explain in a few sentences why changing state triggers React to re-render the component.”

## Mini-Exercise

Build a small component that keeps a counter (state) and has a button to increment it; pass the counter value as a prop to a child component that displays “You have {value} follow-ups today.”
